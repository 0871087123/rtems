# We use TFTP to transfer files to the MVME167. We generate binary files
# rather than S-records. We skip the header during downloads.

# The following are definitions of make-exe which will work using ld as
# is currently required.  It is expected that as of gcc 2.8, the end user
# will be able to override parts of the compilers specs and link using gcc.

# The MC68040 does not implement all MC68881/MC68882 instructions, so use
# either the gcc floating-point software support (msoft-float libraries), or
# use the Motorola FPSP floating-point emulator in
#   rtems/c/src/lib/libcpu/m68k/m68040/fpsp
# The default is to use the FPSP. 
# To use the msoft-float libraries, uncomment the three lines below.
# You then should comment the M68KFPSPInstallExceptionHandlers() statement
# in rtems/c/src/lib/libbsp/m68k/mvme167/startup/bststart.c in bsp_start().
# Floating-point support will then be limited. See the mvme167 README file
# for more details.
