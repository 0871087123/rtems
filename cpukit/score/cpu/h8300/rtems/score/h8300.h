 *  This macro is defined to handle a couple of places where 
 *  addresses are cast to pointers.  There really should be 
 *  a "int-pointer" type that pointers are cast to before being
 *  mathematcically manipulated.  When that is added, search
 *  for all references to this macro and remove them.
