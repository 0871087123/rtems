/*
 *  Mips CPU Dependent Source
 *
 *  2002:       Greg Menke (gregory.menke@gsfc.nasa.gov)
 *      Overhauled interrupt level and interrupt enable/disable code
 *      to more exactly support MIPS.  Our mods were for MIPS1 processors
 *      MIPS3 ports are affected, though apps written to the old behavior
 *      should still work OK.
 *
 *  Conversion to MIPS port by Alan Cudmore <alanc@linuxstart.com> and
 *           Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>. 
 *
 *    These changes made the code conditional on standard cpp predefines,
 *    merged the mips1 and mips3 code sequences as much as possible,
 *    and moved some of the assembly code to C.  Alan did much of the
 *    initial analysis and rework.  Joel took over from there and
 *    wrote the JMR3904 BSP so this could be tested.  Joel also
 *    added the new interrupt vectoring support in libcpu and
 *    tried to better support the various interrupt controllers.
