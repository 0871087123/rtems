The files in this directory are not considered the "primary" source
of inlined routines for RTEMS.  The "inline" directory contains
the implementations of the inlined basis which are regularly
tested.  In general, an effort is made to keep the contents of
this directory up to date but testing is only performed irregularly
and even then it is usually with a single target processor and BSP.

The primary purpose of the code in this directory is to ensure
that RTEMS can be compiled using a C compiler which does not support
static inline routines.
