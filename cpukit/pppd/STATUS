The pppd application seems to very stable.  It has been tested using
the example application with the i386/pc586 and m68k/sbc5206e BSPs.
The tests were executed using a null modem serial cable to connect
with a UNIX box running either the ppp or pppd application and with
an external modem to dial up a local ISP.

If you have problems getting your target to make consistent connections
with an ISP, the problem is most likely with the ppp options.  First
try using the "novj" and "noaccomp" options.  If you have questions
about what other option values are available for the rtems_pppd_set_option
function, please look at the pppd.8 man page file or the the source code.
The majority of options that are documented in man page should work
with this function call.

The pppd application requires the BSP termios driver support task
driven I/O.  Below is a list of known issues that need to be resolved:

  - pppd locks up when it receives large packet pings (> 1500 bytes)
  - pppd occasionaly locks up with mbuf allocation error
    (problem is rare and may be BSP related)

If you find any other problems or fix some problems, please post your
changes to the RTEMS mailing list.

Good Luck
