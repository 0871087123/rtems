Notes from Mike Siers <mikes@poliac.com>
========================================

I know that several users have tried out this version of
pppd under RTEMS.  It has been successfully used as both
a client and server.  Below are the only issues that I
know of.

1) Large packet ping causes RTEMS box to lock up
   If you ping the RTEMS box over the ppp link with a packet
   size greater than 1500, the RTEMS box locks up.  I think
   the problem is in the pppd ethernet driver.

2) Upgrade the libnetworking/modem files
   This upgrade did not modify the ppp ethernet driver files
   in the libnetworking/modem directory.  Would like to
   upgrade these files.  Hopefully, it will fix the large
   packet ping problem.

3) The files cbcp.c and cbcp.h provide a callback feature
   that I have not tried to compile or use.  The files in 
   this directory are identical to the 2.3.11 versions.  
   for completeness.


JOEL: Are the modifications to the original pppd such that the 
      real maintainers will accept them?

No.  The pppd 2.3.11 branch is an old branch.  The current
version is 2.4.x and it contains alot of extra items that
just did not make sense to have in an embedded environment.
I could make the RTEMS changes compatible with the standard
2.3.11 release by using compilation flags.  I have not
contacted the maintainers to see if they are interested.
