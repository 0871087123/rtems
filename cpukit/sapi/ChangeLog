	* POSIX include files merged into newlib.  This resulted in
	some definitions moving to other files and thus some secondary
	effects in RTEMS source code.
	* include/confdefs.h: Replaced include of <sys/siginfo.h> with
	<signal.h> since that file no longer exists.

2000-10-18	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* include/confdefs.h: Set CONFIGURE_INIT_TASK_STACK_SIZE to 0
	if there is no Classic API Initialization Tasks Table defined.

2000-10-18	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* include/confdefs.h: Modified code that accounts for initialization
	task/threads with greater than minimum stack sizes so it would
	compile even if optional APIs are disabled.

2000-10-12	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* include/confdefs.h: Account for initialization tasks and
	threads which use larger than minimum stack sizes.

2000-09-28	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* include/rtems/io.h (rtems_driver_address_table): Added "_entry"
	to all names.
	* src/io.c: Accounted for above.

2000-09-04	Ralf Corsepius <corsepiu@faw.uni-ulm.de>
