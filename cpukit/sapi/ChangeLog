	* src/Makefile.am: Add libsapi.a.

2002-07-22	Ralf Corsepius <corsepiu@faw.uni-ulm.de>

	* src/Makefile.am: Use .$(OBJEXT) instead of .o.

2002-07-04	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* Jump table for single entry point removed.
	* include/rtems/directives.h, src/entrytable.c: Removed.
	* include/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.am, src/exinit.c:  Modified to
	reflect above.

2002-07-01    Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* Mega patch merge to change the format of the object IDs to
	loosen the dependency between the SCORE and the various APIs.
	There was considerable work to simplify the object name management
        and it appears that the name_table field is no longer needed.
	This patch also includes the addition of the internal mutex
	which is currently only used to protect some types of allocation
	and deallocation.  This significantly can reduce context 
	switch latency under certain circumstances.  In particular,
	some heap/region operations were O(n) and had dispatching
	disabled.  This should help enormously.  With this merge,
	the patch is not as clean as it should be.  In particular,
	the documentation has not been modified to reflect the new object
	ID layout, the IDs in the test screens are not updated, and
	_Objects_Get_information needs to be a real routine not inlined.
	As part of this patch a lot of MP code for thread/proxy blocking
	was made conditional and cleaned up.
	* include/confdefs.h, src/exinit.c, src/extension.c, src/itronapi.c,
	src/posixapi.c, src/rtemsapi.c:  Modified as part of above.

2001-05-09	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* src/exinit.c: Slightly rework initialization so there
	is a valid thread as _Thread_Executing when the pre_tasking
	hook is called.  This allows one directives and malloc
	to potentially use mutex protection.
 
2001-03-29	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* Per PR126, configuration structures now match docs.
	* include/rtems/config.h: Use public data types.

2001-03-28	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* PR132 requested some tinkering ot lower memory.
	* include/confdefs.h: Lowered footprint of device driver table
	and statically configure user extensions.  Now if no static
	extensions are configured, then the table is not instantiated.

2002-03-27	Ralf Corsepius <corsepiu@faw.uni-ulm.de>

	* Makefile.am: Remove AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS.
	* include/Makefile.am: Remove AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS.
	* inline/Makefile.am: Remove AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS.
	* macros/Makefile.am: Remove AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS.
	* src/Makefile.am: Remove AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS.

2001-03-15	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* src/extension.c: Split to reduce minimum code size per PR134.
	* src/extensioncreate.c, src/extensiondelete.c, src/extensionident.c:
	New files.
	src/Makefile.am: Modified to reflect above.

2002-01-07	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* optman/, optman/.cvsignore, optman/Makefile.am, optman/no-ext.c,
	optman/no-io.c: Removed entire contents of optman/ directory since
	it has been moved.

2001-12-19	Ralf Corsepius <corsepiu@faw.uni-ulm.de>

	* optman/Makefile.am: Add multilib support.
	* src/Makefile.am: Add multilib support.

2001-10-16	Chris Johns <ccj@acm.org>

	* include/confdefs.h, include/rtems/config.h, include/rtems/io.h,
	optman/no-io.c, src/exinit.c, src/io.c: Added a device driver
	register/unregister interface to allow device drivers to be
	installed and removed at runtime. This means you do not need devices
	present in the device table when you build.

2001-10-16	Ralf Corsepius <corsepiu@faw.uni-ulm.de>

	* include/rtems/Makefile.am: Remove.
	* include/Makefile.am: Handle subdirs, require automake-1.5.
	* inline/rtems/Makefile.am: Remove.
	* inline/Makefile.am: Handle subdirs, require automake-1.5.
	* macros/rtems/Makefile.am: Remove.
	* Makefile.am: require automake-1.5.

2001-10-12	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* include/rtems/directives.h: Fixed typo.

2001-09-28	Ralf Corsepius <corsepiu@faw.uni-ulm.de>

	* include/rtems/Makefile.am: Use 'PREINSTALL_FILES ='.
	* include/Makefile.am: Use 'PREINSTALL_FILES ='.
	* inline/rtems/Makefile.am: Use 'PREINSTALL_FILES ='.
	* macros/rtems/Makefile.am: Use 'PREINSTALL_FILES ='.

2001-09-22	Ralf Corsepius <corsepiu@faw.uni-ulm.de>

	* optman/Makefile.am: Adapt ASM4FLAGS to automake-1.5.

2001-04-16	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* include/confdefs.h: Fix real-time clock support.

2001-02-03	Ralf Corsepius <corsepiu@faw.uni-ulm.de>

	* include/Makefile.am, include/rtems/Makefile.am,
	inline/rtems/Makefile.am, macros/rtems/Makefile.am:
	Apply include_*HEADERS instead of H_FILES.

2001-01-28	Ralf Corsepius <corsepiu@faw.uni-ulm.d>

	* include/confdefs.h: define CONFIGURE_NEWLIB_EXTENSION 0 if not
	using NEWLIB, cleanup related comment.

2001-01-26	Ralf Corsepius <corsepiu@faw.uni-ulm.de>

	* include/confdefs.h: include cpuopts.h, replace stubdr w/ devnull.

2000-10-30	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* POSIX include files merged into newlib.  This resulted in
	some definitions moving to other files and thus some secondary
	effects in RTEMS source code.
	* include/confdefs.h: Replaced include of <sys/siginfo.h> with
	<signal.h> since that file no longer exists.

2000-10-18	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* include/confdefs.h: Set CONFIGURE_INIT_TASK_STACK_SIZE to 0
	if there is no Classic API Initialization Tasks Table defined.

2000-10-18	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* include/confdefs.h: Modified code that accounts for initialization
	task/threads with greater than minimum stack sizes so it would
	compile even if optional APIs are disabled.

2000-10-12	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* include/confdefs.h: Account for initialization tasks and
	threads which use larger than minimum stack sizes.

2000-09-28	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* include/rtems/io.h (rtems_driver_address_table): Added "_entry"
	to all names.
	* src/io.c: Accounted for above.

2000-09-04	Ralf Corsepius <corsepiu@faw.uni-ulm.de>

	* src/Makefile.am, optman/Makefile.am: Include compile.am.

2000-08-10	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* ChangeLog: New file.
