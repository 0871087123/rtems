This is the list of outstanding problems in this release.

+   The POSIX threads and real time extensions code in this tree does
    not work yet and is intentionally not in the normal build path.

+   The m68000 support is nearly complete now.  The missing piece
    inside the executive proper is support for the software interrupt 
    stack.  Also, the m68k family has become quite large and an 
    understanding of the compatibility of the peripherals on the various 
    members of the 683xx family would allow someone to designate some
    of the drivers submitted for the gen683xx BSPs as useful on other
    members.

+   The only i960 family member tested is the CA.  No support for the
    floating point support found in other family members is present.
    This also implies that RTEMS may "think" of something as generic
    across the i960 family when in fact it is specific to the CA.

+   The __read() system call in all of the BSPs using single
    character input/output needs to be smarter.  The following
    issues need to be addressed:

       + echoing of characters on input
       + CR/NL echoing
       + backspaces
       + tabs

+   UNIX port notes:

       + sometimes a stray SIGALRM is reported as spfatal completes.

       + There are conflicts between the names of native library routines
         which MUST be used and those in the POSIX support.  This must
         be addressed. 

+   Some of the tests may execute correctly and not produce the exact
    ordering of lines in the screen file.  This appears to be a combination
    of a number of factors including buffering, processor speed, IO
    device overhead, and clock interrupt rate.

+   The compiler configuration files (c/make/gcc-XYZ.cfg) are largely
    the same when the different targets have the same CPU.  It would
    be desirable to have a gcc-CPU.cfg or gcc-CPU_MODEL.cfg (e.g.
    gcc-m68k.cfg or gcc-m68020.cfg) and have the file gcc-TARGET.cfg
    include this and possibly override default settings.
 
+   The clock device drivers should really avoid doing the division
    by 1000 in the clock tick ISR to convert microseconds into
    milliseconds.  This only applies to clock drivers which generate
    an ISR each millisecond and only call rtems_clock_tick every
    so many ISRs.
