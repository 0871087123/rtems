This is the list of outstanding problems in this release.

1.  The m68000 support is not complete.  Someone with target hardware
    needs to complete the missing gaps.  Look for ifdef's based on the
    M68K_* macros defined in c/make/cpu/m68k.cfg.  Most of the code
    is present but none of it is tested.  An attempt was made to insert
    "#warnings" preprocessor directives in the appropriate places.
    So these are a good starting spot.

2.  The only i960 family member tested is the CA.  No support for the
    floating point support found in other family members is present.
    This also implies that RTEMS may "think" of something as generic
    across the i960 family when in fact it is specific to the CA.

3.  The __read() system call in all of the BSPs using single
    character input/output needs to be smarter.  The following
    issues need to be addressed:

       + echoing of characters on input
       + CR/NL echoing
       + backspaces
       + tabs

4.  Solaris 2.3 port notes:

       + Some of the tests run correctly when run interactively but
         the screen and output do not match when the output is 
         redirected to a file.

       + sometimes a stray SIGALRM is reported as spfatal completes.

5.  Some of the tests may execute correctly and not produce the exact
    ordering of lines in the screen file.  This appears to be a combination
    of a number of factors including buffering, processor speed, IO
    device overhead, and clock interrupt rate.
