General
=======

+ Hardware flow control is not currently supported.  Some of the chip
  drivers (in particular the z8530) have support for hardware flow control
  but this has not been tested in the libchip context.  There will need
  to be a way to totally disabled hardware flow control which is not
  currently in this.

+ "ulClockSpeed" configuration item field to become a pointer to a table
  of chip specific information.  For example, the z8530 should specify
  clock speed and clock divisor setting.

+ A termios structure should be included to specify  the initial settings.
  Right now all drivers default to 9600, 8N1.
 

MC68681
=======

+ Works interrupt and polled.

+ Hardware flow control not included.

NS16650
=======

+ Not tested in libchip context.  Based on Radstone PPC2 driver which worked 
  well.

+ Interrupt code needs to be reworked to eliminate Ring_buffer usage.  This
  will probably require managing the interrupt mask register as is 
  done in the mc68681 and z85c30 drivers.

+ Missing set attributes function.

Z85C30
======

+ Works polled and interrupt.

+ Hardware flow control included but is currently disabled.

+ Needs to support mode where more specific vectors are generated.
