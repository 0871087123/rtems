Driver for smc91111 chip  - README
----------------------------------

The driver for SMC's 91111 ethernet chip.

Each BSP must provide its own attach function.  Examples can be found
in the SPARC leon2 and leon3 BSPs.  The attach function for the leon3
BSP is rtems_smc91111_driver_attach_leon3().

Tested on leon2, using the Pender Electronic Design GR-CPCI-AT697 board.
