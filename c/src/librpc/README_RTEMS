Most of the FreeBSD rpc library ports to RTEMS with little
or no modification, but some of the library has not made it into
the RTEMS implementation.  FreeBSD source files which have been
left out include:
- Files which provide RPC to the AF_UNIX address family:
	clnt_unix.c
	svc_unix.c
- Files which need NIS:
	auth_time.c
- Files which provide DES authentication:
	auth_des.c
	authdes_prot.c
	crypt_client.c
	des_crypt.c
	des_soft.c
	getpublickey.c
	key_call.c
	key_prot_xdr.c
	svc_auth_des.c

The FreeBSD xdr source compiles and runs on RTEMS without modification.
