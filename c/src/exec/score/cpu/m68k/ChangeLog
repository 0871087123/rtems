	* sim.h: These changes enable RTEMS to automatically generate
	the ram_init file used by gdb with the BDM patches. The 332 has
	on-board chip select lines (for RAM and FLASH) that must be
	configured before use of these peripherals. These patches parse
	data from start.c where the chip select lines are configured in
	the runtime executable and automatically generates the gdb
	initialization file using the same settings. A great time saver.
	A similar file, ram_init_FW (flash writable), is also generated
	that the flash programming tool uses.
	* BSP/start/start.c: Must be modified to support above.
	* BSP/start/ram_init.ld, BSP/start/ram_init.sed: New files.
