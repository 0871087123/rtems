	* cpu_asm.S: Changed "_CPU_Ccontext_switch_restore: typo to
	correct name of _CPU_Context_switch_restore.  Added dummy
	version of exc_utlb_code() so applications would link.

2000-11-09	Ralf Corsepius <corsepiu@faw.uni-ulm.de>

	* Makefile.am: Use ... instead of RTEMS_TOPdir in ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS.

2000-11-02	Ralf Corsepius <corsepiu@faw.uni-ulm.de>

	* Makefile.am: Switch to ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS = -I $(RTEMS_TOPdir)/aclocal.

2000-10-25	Ralf Corsepius <corsepiu@faw.uni-ulm.de>

	* Makefile.am: ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS= -I $(RTEMS_TOPdir)/macros.
        Switch to GNU canonicalization.

	* This is a major reworking of the mips64orion port to use 
	gcc predefines as much as possible and a big push to multilib
	the mips port.  The mips64orion port was copied/renamed to mips
	to be more like other GNU tools.  Alan did most of the technical
	work of determining how to map old macro names used by the mips64orion
	port to standard compiler macro definitions.  Joel did the merge
	with CVS magic to keep individual file history and did the BSP
	modifications. Details follow:
	* Makefile.am: idtmon.h in mips64orion port not present.
	* asm.h: MIPS64ORION replaced with MIPS. Frame setup macros added.
	* cpu.c: Comments added.
	* cpu_asm.S: Conditionals changed.  MIPS ISA level 1 support added.
	First attempt at exception/interrupt processing for ISA level 1 
	and minus any use of IDT/MON added.
	* idtcpu.h: Conditionals changed to use gcc predefines.
	* iregdef.h: Ditto.
	* cpu_asm.h: No real change.  Merger required commit.
	* rtems/Makefile.am: Ditto.
	* rtems/score/Makefile.am: Ditto.
	* rtems/score/cpu.h: Change MIPS64ORION to MIPS.
	* rtems/score/mips64orion.h: Change MIPS64ORION to MIPS.  Convert
	from using RTEMS_CPU_MODEL to gcc predefines to figre things out.

2000-09-04	Ralf Corsepius <corsepiu@faw.uni-ulm.de>

	* Makefile.am: Include compile.am.
