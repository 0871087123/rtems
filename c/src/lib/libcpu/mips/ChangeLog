2001-10-11	Ralf Corsepius <corsepiu@faw.uni-ulm.de>

	* .cvsignore: Add autom4te.cache for autoconf > 2.52.
	* configure.in: Remove.
	* configure.ac: New file, generated from configure.in by autoupdate.

2001-09-27	Ralf Corsepius <corsepiu@faw.uni-ulm.de>

	* tx39/include/Makefile.am: Use 'TMPINSTALL_FILES ='.
	* mongoosev/include/Makefile.am: Use 'TMPINSTALL_FILES ='.
	* mongoosev/duart/Makefile.am: Use 'PREINSTALL_FILES ='.
	* shared/cache/Makefile.am: Use 'PREINSTALL_FILES ='.
	* shared/cache/Makefile.am: Use 'CLEANFILES ='.

2000-05-24	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* mongoosev/include/mongoose-v.h, mongoosev/vectorisrs/vectorisrs.c,
	r46xx/vectorisrs/vectorisrs.c, tx39/vectorisrs/vectorisrs.c,
	tx39/include/tx3904.h: All exceptions were given low numbers and thus
	can be now be installed and processed in a uniform manner just like interrupts.
	Variances between various MIPS ISA levels are not accounted for at this time.
	* mongoosev/vectorisrs/Makefile.am, mongoosev/vectorisrs/maxvectors.c,
	r46xx/vectorisrs/Makefile.am, r46xx/vectorisrs/maxvectors.c,
	tx39/vectorisrs/Makefile.am, tx39/vectorisrs/maxvectors.c,
	shared/interrupts/maxvectors.c, shared/interrupts/Makefile.am: Split the
	shared maxvectors.c into a variety of CPU model specific versions to simplify
	the build process and reduce depdencies.  Deleted shared/interrupts/maxvectors.c
	and created various CPU model versions.

2001-05-24	Greg Menke <gregory.menke@gsfc.nasa.gov>

	* clock/clock.S: Move placement of nop.

2001-05-22	Greg Menke <gregory.menke@gsfc.nasa.gov>

	* Assisted in design and debug by Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>.
	* mongoosev/duart/mg5uart.c, mongoosev/duart/mg5uart.h,
	mongoosev/include/mongoose-v.h, mongoosev/vectorisrs/vectorisrs.c,
	shared/interrupts/maxvectors.c: Now works.  Significant rework
	of exceptions and interrupt vectoring to clean things up.
	* shared/interrupts/vectorexceptions.c: Removed.

2001-05-07	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* shared/interrupts/vectorexceptions.c: New file to decode
	exception code and vector appropriate NON-interrupt exception.	
	* shared/interrupts/Makefile.am: Modified to reflect above.

2001-04-20	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* mongoosev/duart/mg5uart.c (mg5uart_enable_interrupts): Honor
	the other bits set in the Peripheral Function Interrupt Mask
	Register when modifying those enabled for the DUART.
	* mongoosev/include/mongoose-v.h (MONGOOSEV_ATOMIC_MASK,
	MONGOOSEV_PFICR, MONGOOSEV_PFIMR, mongoosev_set_in_pficr,
	mongoosev_clear_in_pficr, mongoosev_set_in_pfimr,
	mongoosev_clear_in_pfimr, MONGOOSEV_UART_ALL_IRQ_BITS): New macros.

2001-04-16	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* mongoosev/duart/mg5uart.c, mongoosev/duart/mg5uart.h
	Modifications made with Gregory Menke <gregory.menke@gsfc.nasa.gov>
	as he debugged this BSP using a logic analyzer.  In particular,
	there was a mistake where the index not offset of registers was
	in the header file and the baud rate calculation was incorrect.

2001-03-13	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* Added mongoose-v, mongoose-v/include, and mongoose-v/vectorisrs
	directories.
	* mongoosev/.cvsignore, mongoosev/Makefile.am, mongoosev/README,
	mongoosev/duart/.cvsignore, mongoosev/duart/Makefile.am,
	mongoosev/duart/README.mguart, mongoosev/duart/mg5uart.c,
	mongoosev/duart/mg5uart.h, mongoosev/duart/mg5uart_reg.c,
	mongoosev/include/.cvsignore, mongoosev/include/Makefile.am,
	mongoosev/include/mongoose-v.h, mongoosev/vectorisrs/.cvsignore,
	mongoosev/vectorisrs/Makefile.am, mongoosev/vectorisrs/vectorisrs.c:
	New files.
	* Makefile.am, configure.in, shared/interrupts/Makefile.am,
	shared/interrupts/maxvectors.c: Added support for mongoosev.
	* tx39/vectorisrs/vectorisrs.c: Corrected warning.

2001-03-03	Ralf Corsepius <corsepiu@faw.uni-ulm.de>

	* shared/cache/Makefile.am, tx39/include/Makefile.am:
	Apply include_*HEADERS instead of H_FILES.

2001-01-08	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* Added r46xx directory.
	* Makefile.am, configure.in: Modified to reflect addition of r46xx.
	* shared/interrupts/installisrentries.c: Fixed typo.
	* r46xx/.cvsignore, r46xx/Makefile.am,
	r46xx/vectorisrs/.cvsignore, r46xx/vectorisrs/Makefile.am,
	r46xx/vectorisrs/vectorisrs.c: New files.

2000-12-19	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* tx39/vectorisrs/vectorisrs.c: Modified to have default exception
	vector handler.  This should be in a separate file so the BSP can
	easily override it.

2000-12-13	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* configure.in: Added new directories.
	* shared/interrupts/Makefile.am: Added AM_CPPFLAGS to define TX39
	when compiling for a TX3904.
	* shared/interrupts/maxvectors.c: Corrected conditional logic.
	* tx39/Makefile.am: Added vectorisrs.
	* tx39/vectorisrs/Makefile.am, tx39/vectorisrs/vectorisrs.c,
	* tx39/vectorisrs/.cvsignore: New files.  This decodes the
	interrupt pending information on the TX3904 and vectors
	an interrupt.

2000-12-13	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* shared/.cvsignore, shared/Makefile.am,
	shared/cache/.cvsignore, shared/cache/Makefile.am,
	shared/cache/cache.c, shared/cache/cache_.h,
	shared/interrupts/.cvsignore, shared/interrupts/Makefile.am,
	shared/interrupts/installisrentries.c,
	shared/interrupts/isr_entries.S,
	shared/interrupts/maxvectors.c, tx39/.cvsignore,
	tx39/Makefile.am, tx39/include/.cvsignore,
	tx39/include/Makefile.am, tx39/include/tx3904.h: New file.
	Moved some pieces of interrupt processing from score/cpu to
	libcpu/mips since many interrupt servicing characteristics are
	CPU model dependent.  This patch addresses the number of interrupt
	sources and where the ISR prologues are located.  The only way to
	currently install the ISR prologues requires that the prologues
	be installed into RAM.

2000-11-09	Ralf Corsepius <corsepiu@faw.uni-ulm.de>

	* Makefile.am: Use ... instead of RTEMS_TOPdir in ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS.

2000-11-02	Ralf Corsepius <corsepiu@faw.uni-ulm.de>

	* Makefile.am: Switch to ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS = -I $(RTEMS_TOPdir)/aclocal.

2000-10-26	Ralf Corsepius <corsepiu@faw.uni-ulm.de>

	* Makefile.am: ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS= -I $(RTEMS_TOPdir)/macros.
        Switch to GNU canonicalization.

2000-10-24	Alan Cudmore <alanc@linuxstart.com> and
	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* This is a major reworking of the mips64orion port to use 
	gcc predefines as much as possible and a big push to multilib
	the mips port.  The mips64orion port was copied/renamed to mips
	to be more like other GNU tools.  Alan did most of the technical
	work of determining how to map old macro names used by the mips64orion
	port to standard compiler macro definitions.  Joel did the merge
	with CVS magic to keep individual file history and did the BSP
	modifications. Details follow:
	* Makefile.am: Made clock and timer subdirectories conditional.
	* configure.in: Ditto.
	* clock/clock.S: Switch from using <idtmon.h> to <asm.h>.
	* clock/gettime.S: Switch from using <idtmon.h> to <asm.h>.

2000-09-04	Ralf Corsepius <corsepiu@faw.uni-ulm.de>

	* clock/Makefile.am, timer/Makefile.am: Include compile.am

2000-08-10	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* ChangeLog: New file.
