	* This is a major reworking of the mips64orion port to use 
	gcc predefines as much as possible and a big push to multilib
	the mips port.  The mips64orion port was copied/renamed to mips
	to be more like other GNU tools.  Alan did most of the technical
	work of determining how to map old macro names used by the mips64orion
	port to standard compiler macro definitions.  Joel did the merge
	with CVS magic to keep individual file history and did the BSP
	modifications. Details follow:
	* Makefile.am: Made clock and timer subdirectories conditional.
	* configure.in: Ditto.
	* clock/clock.S: Switch from using <idtmon.h> to <asm.h>.
	* clock/gettime.S: Switch from using <idtmon.h> to <asm.h>.

	* clock/Makefile.am, timer/Makefile.am: Include compile.am

	* ChangeLog: New file.
