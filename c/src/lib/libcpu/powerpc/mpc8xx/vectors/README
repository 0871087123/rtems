The location of the vectors file object is critical.

From the comments at the head of vectors.S:

  The issue with this file is getting it loaded at the right place.
  The first vector MUST be at address 0x????0100.
  How this is achieved is dependant on the tool chain.

...

  The variable 'PPC_VECTOR_FILE_BASE' must be defined to be the
  offset from 0x????0000 to the first location in the file.  This
  will be either 0x0000 or 0xfff0.

The eth_comm BSP defines PPC_VECTOR_FILE_BASE to be 0x00000000.
The MBX8xx BSP also defines PPC_VECTOR_FILE_BASE to be 0x00000000.
Change these values to 0xFFF00000 if your are implementing an actual
boot rom.
