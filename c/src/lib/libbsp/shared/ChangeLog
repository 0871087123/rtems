	* bsplibc.c: assoc.h, error.h, libio_.h, libio.h, and
	libcsupport.h moved from libc to lib/include/rtems and
	now must be referenced as <rtems/XXX.h>.   Header file order
	was cleaned up while doing this.

	* POSIX include files merged into newlib.  This resulted in
	some definitions moving to other files and thus some secondary
	effects in RTEMS source code.
	* sbrk.c: Corrected prototype to match newlib.

	* ChangeLog: New file.
