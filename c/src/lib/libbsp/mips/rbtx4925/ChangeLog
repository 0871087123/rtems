	* Makefile.am, startup/bspstart.c: Moved most of the remaining CPU
	Table fields to the Configuration Table. This included
	pretasking_hook, predriver_hook, postdriver_hook, idle_task,
	do_zero_of_workspace, extra_mpci_receive_server_stack,
	stack_allocate_hook, and stack_free_hook. As a side-effect of this
	effort some multiprocessing code was made conditional and some style
	clean up occurred.

	* bsp_specs: Remove qrtems_debug.

2007-04-09	Ralf Corsépius	<ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* bsp_specs: Remove lib (Now expected to exist in GCC).

2007-03-12	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* console/console-io.c, startup/exception.S: Correct license URL and/or

	PR 1227/bsps
	* include/bsp.h: Remove MAX_LONG_TEST_DURATION and

	* configure.ac: New BUG-REPORT address.

2006-11-15	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>
