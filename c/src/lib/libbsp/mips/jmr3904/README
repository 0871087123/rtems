Simple BSP for the TX3904 simulator built into gdb.

Simulator Invocation
====================
The following is how the simulator is invoked.

target sim --board=jmr3904

GDB must be configured with a target like "tx39-rtems".  Otherwise,
the simulator will not be built for the correct instruction
and peripheral set.

Status
======

+ hello.exe locks up while running the global destructors.  This almost
  has to be a linkcmds issue.

+ There is no clock tick device driver.

+ There is no timer device driver.
