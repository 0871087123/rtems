Simple BSP for the TX3904 simulator built into gdb.

Simulator Invocation
====================
The following is not 100% correct since it does not work.   :)

target sim --board=jmr3904pal --memory-region 0xffff8000,0x900 \ 
  --memory-region 0xffffe000,0x4 --memory-region 0xb2100000,0x4 
  --memory-region 0x8800000,0x100000 -memory-region 0x80000000,0x40000 \
  --memory-region 0xfffff300,0x10

Status
======
This BSP is not working.  It gets to the point where the 
console_outbyte_polled() routine is called during printf
and it locks up checking for a status bit.  This is probably
a simulator initialization issue related to the setup command.
As of 25 Nov 2000, email was sent to the gdb and newlib maintainers
asking for advice.
