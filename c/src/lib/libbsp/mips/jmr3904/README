Simple BSP for the TX3904 simulator built into gdb.

Simulator Invocation
====================
The following is not 100% correct since it does not work.   :)

target sim --board=jmr3904pal --memory-region 0x8800000,0x100000

Status
======

+ printk() works and is being called from bsp_start as prove.

+ There appears to be a compilation problem in _Thread_Handler_initialization
where _Thread_Ready_chain[1] is only 1 byte -- not 12 from
_Thread_Ready_chain[0].   I am throwing this to the RTEMS list
first before reporting it.

Made it to bsp_start
mips-core: 4 byte write to unaligned address 0x8803bb01 at 0x8800d83c

Program received signal SIGBUS, Bus error.
0x8800d83c in _Chain_Initialize_empty (the_chain=0x8803bb01)
    at ../../../../../jmr3904/lib/include/rtems/score/chain.inl:222
222	  the_chain->first          = _Chain_Tail( the_chain );
