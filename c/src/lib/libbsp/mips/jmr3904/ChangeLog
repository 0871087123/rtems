2001-10-11	Ralf Corsepius <corsepiu@faw.uni-ulm.de>

	* .cvsignore: Add autom4te.cache for autoconf > 2.52.
	* configure.in: Remove.
	* configure.ac: New file, generated from configure.in by autoupdate.

2001-09-27	Ralf Corsepius <corsepiu@faw.uni-ulm.de>

	* include/Makefile.am: Use 'CLEANFILES ='.
	* include/Makefile.am: Use 'TMPINSTALL_FILES ='.

2001-05-23	Ralf Corsepius <corsepiu@faw.uni-ulm.de>

	* configure.in: Add bspopts.h.
	* include/bsp.h: Include bspopts.h.
	* include/.cvsignore: Add bspopts.h*, coverhd.h, stamp-h*.
	* include/Makefile.am: Use *_HEADERS instead of *H_FILES.

2001-05-11	Ralf Corsepius	<corsepiu@faw.uni-ulm.de>

	* configure.in: Use RTEMS_PROG_CC_FOR_TARGET([-ansi -fasm]).

2001-05-11	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* tools/runtest: Add functionality to avoid letting simulator
	run too long.

2001-04-20	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* include/bsp.h (Clear_tm27_intr): Stop the timer and disable
	the interrupt.  This was not quite right before and we were
	getting uncontrolled interrupt nesting in tm27.
	* timer/timer.c (Timer_Initialize): Added an extra reset and
	changed the ITMR register so we will never get an interrupt.
	(Read_timer): Fixed so the timer actually stops before it
	is read.  Before some times reported were outraguously high.
	* start/start.S: Major clean including using stack in linkcmds,
	deleting unused code, and zeroing the BSS using the linkcmds
	information.
	* startup/linkcmds: Put heap in lower memory than workspace
	and move _clear_end so both are zeroed.

2001-01-12	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* include/bsp.h, timer/timer.c: Updated so timer appears to
	work and support tm27.  I would prefer to time a software
	interrupt rather than an use an extra timer though.

2001-01-09	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* clock/clockdrv.c: Clean up.
	* include/bsp.h: Uncomment and fix set_vector() prototype.

2001-01-03	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* console/console-io.c: Removed unused variable initialized.

2001-01-03	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* clock/Makefile.am: Fixed reference to ckinit.c.
	* clock/clockdrv.c: Enabled fast idle.
	* console/console-io.c: Added console_initialize_hardware().

2000-12-19	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* timer: New subdirectory.
	* timer/.cvsignore, timer/Makefile.am, timer/timer.c: New files.
	* tools/ChangeLog: New file.

2000-12-19	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* Makefile.am: Added tools subdirectory and removed commented out line.
	* configure.in: Added tools subdirectory.
	* tools: New subdirectory.
	* tools/.cvsignore, tools/Makefile.am, tools/configure.in,
	tools/runtest: New files -- based on powerpc/psim.
	* clock/clockdrv.c: Guessed new value for clock tick.  Need to
	add fast idle support.
	* include/bsp.h: tm27 support initiated.
	* Most tests appear to run correctly!

2000-12-13	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* README: Updated.  We are now vectoring a clock tick ISR handler.
	But RTEMS is not returning from the ISR properly.
	* clock/clockdrv.c: Now causes interrupts but has not been calibrated.
	* include/bsp.h: Use <libcpu/tx3904.h>
	* startup/Makefile.am: Add setvec.c from shared.
	* startup/bspstart.c: Initialize the status register (SR) so
	no interrupts are masked but global interrupts (SR_IEC) are off.
	Added call to install the ISR prologue code.
	* wrapup/Makefile.am: Pick up more pieces from libcpu.

2000-12-11	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/bspclean.c: New file to explicitly invoke _sys_exit().
	* README: Updated.

2000-12-06	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* README: Updated to reflect status.
	* startup/linkcmds: Added .ctor and .dtor sections to no avail.

2000-11-30	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* README: Updated to reflect current status.  Misaligned reference
	during initialization may be compiler problem.
	* console/console-io.c: Added support for printk().
	* startup/linkcmds: Reserve 512K for RTEMS Workspace.

2000-11-27	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/linkcmds: Fix typo and add extra 0 to base address.
	Now runs until printf() tries to put a character and then
	it locks up checking a status bit that does not change.

2000-11-25	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* The JMR BSP is for a Toshiba TX39 evaluation board but
	can also be used with the mips simulator in gdb.
