	* README: Updated.  We are now vectoring a clock tick ISR handler.
	But RTEMS is not returning from the ISR properly.
	* clock/clockdrv.c: Now causes interrupts but has not been calibrated.
	* include/bsp.h: Use <libcpu/tx3904.h>
	* startup/Makefile.am: Add setvec.c from shared.
	* startup/bspstart.c: Initialize the status register (SR) so
	no interrupts are masked but global interrupts (SR_IEC) are off.
	Added call to install the ISR prologue code.
	* wrapup/Makefile.am: Pick up more pieces from libcpu.

	* startup/bspclean.c: New file to explicitly invoke _sys_exit().
	* README: Updated.

2000-12-06	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* README: Updated to reflect status.
	* startup/linkcmds: Added .ctor and .dtor sections to no avail.

2000-11-30	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* README: Updated to reflect current status.  Misaligned reference
	during initialization may be compiler problem.
	* console/console-io.c: Added support for printk().
	* startup/linkcmds: Reserve 512K for RTEMS Workspace.

	* startup/linkcmds: Fix typo and add extra 0 to base address.
	Now runs until printf() tries to put a character and then
	it locks up checking a status bit that does not change.

	* The JMR BSP is for a Toshiba TX39 evaluation board but
	can also be used with the mips simulator in gdb.
