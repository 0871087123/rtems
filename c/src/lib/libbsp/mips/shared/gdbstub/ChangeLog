	* Makefile, stubinit.S, r46kstub.ld, ioaddr.h: Removed as unused
	with RTEMS.
	* r46kstub.c: Renamed to mips-stub.c.
	* mips-stub.c: New file -- was r46kstub.c.
	* memlimits.h: New file was limits.h.
	* limits.h: Removed.
	* r4600.h: Eliminated need for this file.
	* README: Updated.
 	* gdb_if.h: Added CVS Id.
	* mips-stub.c: Attempt to deal with MIPS1 versus MIPS3.

2002-02-08	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* Merged r46kstub.c into RTEMS distribution without modification.
	I got the code from Franz Fischer <Franz.Fischer@franz-fischer.de>
	who had used this with an old version of RTEMS with the mips64orion
	port of RTEMS.  After adding this to the repository, I will tailor
	this to work with the RTEMS exception processing model and trim
	no longer needed parts.
	* ChangeLog, gdb_if.h, ioaddr.h, limits.h, Makefile, mips_opcode.h,
	r4600.h, r46kstub.c, r46kstub.ld, README, stubinit.S:

Sun Sep 29 16:34:53 1996  C. M. Heard <heard@vvnet.com>

	* Updated snapshot posted.

	* stubinit.S (_reset_exception, _general_exception): Reorder
	instructions or insert nops as necessary to ensure that the
	target register of mfc0, mfc1, and cfc1 instructions is not
	used as a source register in the load delay slot of those 
	instructions and to ensure that the instruction following
	mtc0 is always something other than mfc0.  Insert .eject
	directives and reformat some of the comments to make the
	assembler listing more readable.

	* ioaddr.h:  add comments pointing out implementation-
	specific address definitions.

	* limits.h:  add comments describing what the implementation-
	specific macros in this file are supposed to do. 

Tue Aug 06 14:43:04 1995  C. M. Heard <heard@vvnet.com>

	* Updated snapshot posted.

	* stubinit.S (_general_exception): Use virtual adresses from
	kseg0 (cached, unmapped space) instead of kseg1 (uncached,
	unmapped space) in cache instructions.
	(_reset_exception): Likewise, and use the right
	mask to clean the K0 field in the config register.

Fri Jul 26 14:41:49 1995  C. M. Heard <heard@vvnet.com>

	* Initial snapshot posted.
