	* configure.in: Add bspopts.h.
	* include/bsp.h: Include bspopts.h.
	* include/.cvsignore: Add bspopts.h*, coverhd.h, stamp-h*.
	* include/Makefile.am: Use *_HEADERS instead of *H_FILES.

2001-05-24	Greg Menke <gregory.menke@gsfc.nasa.gov>

	* Assisted in design and debug by Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>.
	* start/regs.S, start/start.S: Now works on Mongoose-V.  Missed
	in previous patch.

2001-05-22	Greg Menke <gregory.menke@gsfc.nasa.gov>

	* Assisted in design and debug by Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>.
	* clock/clockdrv.c, console/conscfg.c: Corrected.
	* include/bsp.h: Support for tm27 and addition of CPU_CLOCK_RATE.
	* startup/bspstart.c: Properly set initial status register and
	pending interrupts.
	* timer/timer.c: Works now.

2001-05-10	Ralf Corsepius	<corsepiu@faw.uni-ulm.de>

	* configure.in: Use RTEMS_PROG_CC_FOR_TARGET([-ansi -fasm]).

2001-05-07	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* console/conscfg.c: Added an entry for the second
	serial port.

2001-04-20	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* clock/clockdrv.c: Account for the fact that ClockRate is
	in cycles not megahertz.

2001-04-16	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* start/start.S, startup/bspstart.c, startup/linkcmds:
	Cleanup that was not merged from the simple non-RTEMS program.

2001-04-16	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* start/start.S, startup/bspstart.c, startup/linkcmds: 
	Modifications made with Gregory Menke <gregory.menke@gsfc.nasa.gov>
	as he debugged this BSP using a logic analyzer.

2001-03-14	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* clock/clockdrv.c, console/conscfg.c, include/bsp.h, start/start.S,
	startup/bspstart.c, timer/timer.c: Comments corrected.

	* The Generic Mongoose-V BSP uses only the peripherals found on
	the Synova Mongoose-V CPU.  This is a radiation hardened CPU 
	based on the LSI Logic 33K.
