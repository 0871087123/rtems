BSP supporting the on-CPU capabilities of the Synova Mongoose-V.
This BSP assumes that basic HW initialization is performed by
PMON.

Address Map
===========
This is the generic address map of the Mongoose-V prototyping board
this BSP was tested on.

0x8000_0000 - 0x8FFF_FFFF   - RAM (KSEG0 cached)
0xA000_0000 - 0xAFFF_FFFF   - RAM (KSEG1, same memory uncached)
0xBFC0_0000 - 0xBFFF_FFFF   - EEPROM
0xFFFE_xxxx                 - on-CPU peripherals

This is the hardware address map of the board used as it was
actually populated.

0x8000_0000 - 0x83FF_FFFF   - 32 MB RAM (KSEG0 cached)
0xA000_0000 - 0xA3FF_FFFF   - 32 MB RAM (KSEG1, same memory uncached)
0xBFC0_0000 - 0xBFDF_FFFF   - 2 MB EEPROM
0xFFFE_xxxx                 - on-CPU peripherals

This is the organization of the EEPROM when fully populated.  Since
the board used to develop this BSP only had the first bank of EEPROM
populated, only the first program image area was used.

0xBFC0_0000 - 0xBFC3_FFFF   - PMON
0xBFC4_0000 - 0xBFC4_FFFF   - reserved for boot loader
0xBFC5_0000 - 0xBFDF_FFFF   - reserved for program 1 image
0xBFE0_0000 - 0xBFFF_FFFF   - reserved for program 2 image

The Mongoose-V on this board is at 12 Mhz.

Downloading
===========

At startup, PMON looks for a <space> to be pressed.  If it is pressed,
then a PMON prompt is displayed.  Otherwise, PMON automatically jumps
to the code at 0xBFC4_0000.  This code may be a boot manager or
simply a collection of noop's that fall into the code at 
0xBFC5_0000.  If the code at 0xBFC4_0000 is a boot manager, then it
can determine which program image to load.  This layout allows for the
possible compression of program images.  Given that there is much
more RAM than EEPROM, compression could be desirable for certain
applications.
