	PR 1257/bsps
	* startup/bspclean.c: Code outside of cpukit should use the public API
	for rtems_interrupt_disable/rtems_interrupt_enable. By bypassing the
	public API and directly accessing _CPU_ISR_Disable and
	_CPU_ISR_Enable, they were bypassing the compiler memory barrier
	directive which could lead to problems. This patch also changes the
	type of the variable passed into these routines and addresses minor
	style issues.

	* bsp_specs: Remove qrtems_debug.
	Remove *cpp:.

	* include/coverhd.h: Correct license URL and/or fix mistake in
	copyright notice. Both of these mistakes appear to be from code
	submitted after these changes were made previously.

2007-01-08	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* Makefile.am: Use preinstall.am.

2006-12-02	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* configure.ac: New BUG-REPORT address.

2006-11-15	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	file and simplified initialization.

	* Makefile.am: Remove superfluous -DASM.
