	* console/console.c, include/bsp.h, startup/bspstart.c: Move
	interrupt_stack_size field from CPU Table to Configuration Table.
	Eliminate CPU Table from all ports. Delete references to CPU Table in
	all forms.

	* console/console.c, startup/bspstart.c: Moved most of the remaining
	CPU Table fields to the Configuration Table. This included
	pretasking_hook, predriver_hook, postdriver_hook, idle_task,
	do_zero_of_workspace, extra_mpci_receive_server_stack,
	stack_allocate_hook, and stack_free_hook. As a side-effect of this
	effort some multiprocessing code was made conditional and some style
	clean up occurred.

	PR 1257/bsps
	* startup/bspclean.c: Code outside of cpukit should use the public API
	for rtems_interrupt_disable/rtems_interrupt_enable. By bypassing the
	public API and directly accessing _CPU_ISR_Disable and
	_CPU_ISR_Enable, they were bypassing the compiler memory barrier
	directive which could lead to problems. This patch also changes the
	type of the variable passed into these routines and addresses minor
	style issues.

2007-04-12	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* bsp_specs: Remove qrtems_debug.
	Remove *cpp:.

2007-03-12	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* include/coverhd.h: Correct license URL and/or fix mistake in
	copyright notice. Both of these mistakes appear to be from code
	submitted after these changes were made previously.

2007-01-08	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* Makefile.am: Use preinstall.am.

2006-12-02	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* configure.ac: New BUG-REPORT address.

2006-11-15	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* Makefile.am: Merge c_rtems_main() into boot_card(). This eliminated a
	file and simplified initialization.

2006-10-17	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* Makefile.am: Remove superfluous -DASM.

2006-10-17	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* configure.ac: Require autoconf-2.60. Require automake-1.10.

	* .cvsignore: New file.
