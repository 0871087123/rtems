RTEMS bsp for Philips's ARM processor
This BSP is design for Philips's LPC2210/LPC2212/LPC2214/LPC2290/LPC2294 (LPC22xx)  serial ARM processor. Some LPC21xx ARM can also use this.
Philphs's LPC22xx ARM processor got an ARM7TDMI-S core, and can run at 60MHz. It has an external memory bus, and peripherals like UART, I2C, SPI, ADC and etc. Some of them got on chip flash (256k) and CAN.
The board used to develop the board is compatible with LPC-E2214/LPC-E2294 boards from http://www.olimex.com. The board got a 512K SRAM(256K used to store the .text for debug perpose) and two serial ports.
