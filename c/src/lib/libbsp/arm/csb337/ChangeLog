2008-09-23	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@oarcorp.com>

	* configure.ac: Make letting boot_card() handle work area allocation
	mandatory. Rename RTEMS_BSP_BOOTCARD_HANDLES_RAM_ALLOCATION to
	BSP_BOOTCARD_OPTIONS.

2008-09-22	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@oarcorp.com>

	* Makefile.am, configure.ac, startup/bspstart.c: Use standardized
	bsp_cleanup() which can optionally print a message, poll for user to
	press key, and call bsp_reset(). Using this eliminates the various
	bsp_cleanup() implementations which had their own implementation and
	variety of string constants.
	* startup/bspreset.c: New file.
	* startup/bspclean.c: Removed.

2008-09-19	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@oarcorp.com>

	* Makefile.am, startup/linkcmds: Use top level shared
	bsp_get_work_area() implementation.

2008-09-16	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@oarcorp.com>

	* startup/bspstart.c: Remove unnecessary includes of
	rtems/libcsupport.h and rtems/libio.h.

2008-09-12	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* Makefile.am, configure.ac, startup/bspclean.c, startup/bspstart.c:
	Now support bsp_get_work_area() and used shared implementation of it
	and bsp_pretasking_hook.

2008-08-21	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@oarcorp.com>

	* Makefile.am: No BSP should use exit.c as a file name. exit() is POSIX
	routine.
	* startup/bspclean.c: New file.
	* startup/exit.c: Removed.

2008-08-18	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* startup/bspstart.c: Add missing prototypes.

2008-05-14	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* Makefile.am: Rework to avoid .rel files.

2008-05-12	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/bspstart.c: Refactored and renamed initialization routines to
	rtems_initialize_data_structures, rtems_initialize_before_drivers,
	rtems_initialize_device_drivers, and
	rtems_initialize_start_multitasking. This opened the sequence up so
	that bootcard() could provide a more robust and flexible framework
	which is easier to explain and understand. This also lays the
	groundwork for sharing the division of available memory between the
	RTEMS workspace and heap and the C library initialization across all
	BSPs.

2008-03-03	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/linkcmds: Add wildcard to gcc_except_table section so
	programs compiled with gcc 4.3.x can link.

2007-12-11	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* include/bsp.h, startup/bspstart.c: Eliminate copies of the
	Configuration Table. Use the RTEMS provided accessor macros to obtain
	configuration fields.

2007-12-04	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* include/bsp.h, startup/bspstart.c: Move interrupt_stack_size field
	from CPU Table to Configuration Table. Eliminate CPU Table from all
	ports. Delete references to CPU Table in all forms.

2007-12-03	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* Makefile.am, startup/bspstart.c: Moved most of the remaining CPU
	Table fields to the Configuration Table. This included
	pretasking_hook, predriver_hook, postdriver_hook, idle_task,
	do_zero_of_workspace, extra_mpci_receive_server_stack,
	stack_allocate_hook, and stack_free_hook. As a side-effect of this
	effort some multiprocessing code was made conditional and some style
	clean up occurred.

2007-09-12	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	PR 1257/bsps
	* startup/bspstart.c: Code outside of cpukit should use the public
	API for rtems_interrupt_disable/rtems_interrupt_enable. By bypassing
	the public API and directly accessing _CPU_ISR_Disable and
	_CPU_ISR_Enable, they were bypassing the compiler memory barrier
	directive which could lead to problems. This patch also changes the
	type of the variable passed into these routines and addresses minor
	style issues.

2007-05-28	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/bspstart.c: Eliminate maximum_drivers configuration parameter
	since it was used to configure a no longer used feature. Device names
	are now part of the filesystem not in a table.

2007-05-15	Ray Xu <rayx@gmail.com>

	* Makefile.am: Add abort.rel since it is now in the BSP shared source,
	not in score/cpu.

2007-04-12	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* bsp_specs: Remove qrtems_debug.

2007-03-26	Chris Johns <chrisj@rtems.org>

	* include/bsp.h: Terminate comment.

2007-03-12	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* console/uarts.c, include/bsp.h, start/start.S, startup/bspstart.c,
	startup/exit.c, startup/linkcmds: Correct license URL and/or fix
	mistake in copyright notice. Both of these mistakes appear to be from
	code submitted after these changes were made previously.

2007-03-11	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/bspstart.c: Remove assignments of
	Cpu_table.do_zero_of_workspace to TRUE since TRUE is the default
	value in boot_card.c

2006-12-15	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* network/network.c (at91rm9200_emac_ioctl): Use ioctl_command_t.

2006-11-15	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* Makefile.am: Merge c_rtems_main() into boot_card(). This eliminated a
	file and simplified initialization.

2006-11-01	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* bsp_specs: Fix typo.

2006-10-30	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* bsp_specs: Add crti, crtbegin, crtend, and crtn.

2006-10-17	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* Makefile.am: Remove superfluous -DASM.

2006-10-17	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* configure.ac: Require autoconf-2.60. Require automake-1.10.

2006-01-11	Ralf Corsepius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* Makefile.am: Add preinstall.am.

2005-11-22	Ralf Corsepius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* bsp_specs: remove %lib.

2005-11-12	Ralf Corsepius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* bsp_specs: Remove %cpp.

2005-05-26	Ralf Corsepius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* network/network.c: Eliminate warnings.

2005-02-24	Jay Monkman <jtm@lopingdog.com>

	PR 751/bsps
        * startup/linkcmds: Cleanup.
	* network/network.c: Added hardware initialization
	code.

2005-01-07	Ralf Corsepius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

2004-10-21	Ralf Corsepius <ralf_corsepius@rtems.org>

	* startup/bspstart.c: Use POSIX fixed size types.

2004-09-24	Ralf Corsepius <ralf_corsepius@rtems.org>

	* configure.ac: Require automake > 1.9.

2004-07-15	Jay Monkman

	* .cvsignore, ChangeLog, Makefile.am, README, bsp_specs, configure.ac,
	times, console/uarts.c, include/.cvsignore, include/bsp.h,
	include/tm27.h, network/.cvsignore, network/network.c,
