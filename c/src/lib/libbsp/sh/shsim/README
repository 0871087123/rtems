Simple BSP for the SH simulator built into gdb.

Simulator Invocation
====================
sh-rtems[elf|]-gdb <executable>
(gdb) target sim
(gdb) set archi [sh|sh2]
(gdb) load <executable>
(gdb) run

Status
======

* The simulator invocation procedure outlined above produces error messages
with gdb-5.0, nevertheless seems to work. With gdb versions > 5.0 these
error messages are gone. I.e. if you plan to seriously work with the gdb
simulator better use gdb versions > 5.0.

* gdb's simulator is not able to correctly emulate memory areas esp. shadowing
and non-consecutive memory. I.e. access to memory areas besides area 0 will 
(bogusly) generate SIGBUS exceptions.  This includes access to area 5 
(On-chip peripherials) and prevents simulation of configuration of
accesses to on-chip peripherials.

* Due to limitations of the simulator you will only be able to run
applications which do not try to access any SH control registers.

Currently, this excludes all applications, which apply timers and serial 
devices, i.e. almost any real world application.

* The simulator currently uses gdb's trap34 interface for console I/O. This
could be replaced with polled sci1 I/O for SHes > SH1.
