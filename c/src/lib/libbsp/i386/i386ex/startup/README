	The doit shell file cd's to $H, which refers to the directory
that contains the hello world test.  The console is a raw com port.  
Certain test programs behave differently with different com port speeds.
To test the programs, it is required that you hook up a terminal 
( or minicom or procomm it doesn't really matter ) to the comm port of 
the target hardware.  You must ensure that the baud rate, parity etc
is set properly.  This is done on the target hardware within interns.s .
( Set your terminal emulator to match. ) Currently, the settings
are 9600,8,n,1 .

The format and layout of the file interns.s is taken from the 
intel ApBuilder software, freely distributed by Intel.  Some
easy macros ( SetExRegByte and SetExRegWord ) are basically lifted
from the Intel macros.  Similarly for the names of the IO ports.

This "port" begain with the forceCPU bsp.  Hence I am sure that 
there is some real trash that is not appropriate.  For example
the act of copying the Interrupt Descriptor tables and Global
descriptor tables "into our space". ( in start.s I think )
