#
# This board support package is not a board support package at all, but
# a means to build the RTEMS kernel without using a specific BSP.
#
# You should be able to build to build this BSP for any cpu type.
#
# You must provide the standard BSP type functions and support yourself
# externally to RTEMS.
#
# This BSP is intended to be used by people who fit one or more of the 
# categories below :
#
# 1) using custom hardware of little use or interest to others. If you 
#    intend to use hardware available to others, please create a BSP 
#    and send to OARCorp.
#
# 2) production code cannot depend on software which can change. BSP code
#    can change with-out notice, while RTEMS has very tightly defined 
#    interfaces which do not change.
#
# 3) the need to extend or change an existing BSP in ways which are not
#    of interest to others or the BSP maintainer.
#
# I fit all the above.
