	* Makefile.am, start/start.S, startup/linkcmds: Use top level shared
	bsp_get_work_area() implementation.

	* Makefile.am, configure.ac, startup/bspstart.c: Add use of
	bsp_get_work_area() in its own file and rely on BSP Framework to
	perform more initialization. Remove unnecessary includes of
	rtems/libio.h and rtems/libcsupport.h.

2008-09-10	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@oarcorp.com>

	* include/bsp.h: Review of all bsp_cleanup() implementations. In this
	phase, all prototypes were removed from bsp.h and empty
	implementations were removed and made to use the shared stub.

	* timer/timer.c: Convert to "bool".

2008-08-31	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@oarcorp.com>

	* timer/timer.c: Eliminate empty function from every benchmark timer
	driver. Fix spelling.

2008-08-31	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@oarcorp.com>

	* timer/timer.c: Rename timer driver methods to follow RTEMS
	programming conventions.

	* clock/clock.c, startup/init52235.c: Add missing prototypes.

2008-08-18	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* Makefile.am, console/console.c: Split debug IO code into separate
	file.
	* console/debugio.c: New file.

	* startup/cfinit.c, startup/init52235.c: Missed the last patch.

	mcf52235/startup/bspclean.c, mcf52235/startup/bspstart.c,
	mcf52235/startup/linkcmds, mcf52235/timer/timer.c: Cleaned up
	white space and code formmated to adhere to RTEMS standards. Fixed
	a bug in the nano seconds since last tick support. Fixed a bug
	with the location of the start stack (no longer within
	.bss). Removed double definition of IPSBAR and some type defs
	etc.. Added timing test overhead results.
