	* startup/bspstart.c: assoc.h, error.h, libio_.h, libio.h,
	and libcsupport.h moved from libc to lib/include/rtems and
	now must be referenced as <rtems/XXX.h>.   Header file order
	was cleaned up while doing this.

2000-10-27	Ralf Corsepius <corsepiu@faw.uni-ulm.de>

	* configure.in, Makefile.am: ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS= -I $(RTEMS_TOPdir)/macros.
        Switch to GNU canonicalization.

2000-09-29	Charles-Antoine Gauthier <charles.gauthier@nrc.ca>

	* startup/linkcmds: Added lines so DWARF debug information
	would be available.  Otherwise gdb complains that the offsets
	for the debug info are incorrect and doesn't load the files.

2000-09-14	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* include/mvme16x_hw.h: Include rtems/score/targopts.h so we
	can check which BSP this is being used with.

2000-09-04	Ralf Corsepius <corsepiu@faw.uni-ulm.de>

	* clock/Makefile.am, console/Makefile.am, consolex/Makefile.am,
	start/Makefile.am, startup/Makefile.am, timer/Makefile.am,
	tod/Makefile.am, wrapup/Makefile.am, network/Makefile.am: Include
	compile.am

2000-08-25  Charles-Antoine Gauthier  <charles.gauthier@nrc.ca>

	* include/mvme16x_hw.h: Added NVRAM_CONFIGURE macro in
	a manner that should work for 162, 162lx, and 167.

2000-08-10	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* ChangeLog: New file.
