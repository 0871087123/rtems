Installation
------------

Nothing unique to the MVME167. It uses the standard build process for
m68k targets. You will need to edit linkcmds to put in the start address
of your board. We do TFTP transfers to our target. The mvme167.cfg file
builds only the coff images, which we download to the target, skipping over
the first 0xA8 bytes; Motorola S-records are not generated. Edit this file
if you want S-records.


Port Description
----------------

This BSP includes an termios-capable console driver that supports all
four serial ports on the MVME167 model. The RTEMS console, /dev/console,
corresponds to channel 1 in the CD2401. This corresponds to Serial Port
2/TTY01 on the MVME712M. Serial Port 1/Console is normally used by 167Bug;
do not open /dev/tty00 if you are debugging using 167Bug.

The console is initialized with whatever parameters are set up in termios
before it calls the firtOpen driver callback, EXCEPT THAT HARDWARE HANDSHAKING
IS TURNED OFF, i.e. CLOCAL is set in the struct termios c_cflag field. We use
3-wire cables for I/O, and find hardware handshaking a pain. If you enable
hardware handshaking, you must drive CTS* low on the CD2401 for output to
occur. If the port is in the DTE configuration, you must drive the RS-232 CTS
line to space; if the port is in the DCE configuration, you must drive the
RS-232 RTS line to space.

Limited support is provided for polled terminal I/O. This is used when running
the timing tests. Set the CD2401_POLLED_IO manifest constant to 1 in
rtems/c/src/lib/libbsp/m68k/mvme167/console/console.c to enable polled I/O.
In this case, I/O is done through 167Bug, usually to the Serial Port 1/Console
port. Interrupt-driven and polled I/O cannot be mixed in the MVME167.

The timer and clock drivers were patterned after the MVME162 and MVME152
ports.

At this time, we do not have an MPCI layer for the MVME167. We are planning
to write one.

The port does not have a network driver.

This port supplies its own fatal_error_handler, which attempts to print some
error message through 167Bug (on the Serial Port 1/Console on the MVME712M).


Host System
-----------

The port was initially developed on an RS-6000 running AIX 4.2. The following
tools were used:

    - GNU gcc 2.8.1 configured for a powerpc-ibm-aix4.2.0.0 host and
      m68k-rtems target;
    - GNU binutils 2.9.1 configured for a powerpc-ibm-aix4.2.0.0 host and
      m68k-rtems target;
    - Cygnus newlib 1.8.0 with RTEMS 4.0.0 patches.


Known Problems
--------------

The cdtest will not run with interrupt-driven I/O. The reason is that the
constructors for the static objects are called at boot time when the
interrupts are still disabled. The output buffer fills up, but never empties,
and the application goes into an infinite loop waiting for buffer space. This
should have been documented in the rtems/c/src/tests/PROBLEMS file. The moral
of this story is: do not do I/O from the constructors or destructors of static
objects.

The cpuuse and malloctest tests do not work properly, either with polled I/O
or interrupt-driven I/O. They are known not to work with interrupt-driven I/O,
but should work with polled I/O?

Output stops prematurely in the termios test when the console is operating in
interrupt-driven mode because the serial port is re-initialized before all
characters in the last raw output buffer are sent. Adding calls to tcdrain()
in the test task helps, but it does not solve the problem. What happens is
that the CD2401 raises a transmit interrupt when the last character in the
DMA buffer is written into the transmit FIFO, not when the last character
has been transmitted. When tcdrain() returns, there might be up to 16
characters in the output FIFO. The call to tcsetattr() causes the serial port
to re-initialize, at which point the output FIFO is cleared. We could not find
a way to detect whether characters are still in the FIFO and to wait for them
to be transmitted.

The first raw buffer to be transmitted after the console is re-initialized
with tcsetattr() is garbled. At this time, it does not seem worth while to
track this problem down.

In the rtmonuse test, an unimplemented floating point instruction exception
is raised at the end of the test when CPU_usage_Dump() is called. The faulting
instruction is FCMP.X FP0,FP2 in cvt().

In the stackchk test, an access fault exception is raised after the stack is
blown. This is one case were overwritting the first or last 16 bytes of the
stack does cause problems (but hey, an exception occurred, which is better
than propagating the error).

When using interrupt-driven I/O, psx08 produces all the expected output, but
it does not return control to 167Bug. Is this test supposed to work with
interrupt-driven console I/O?

Cache Configuration:  Instruction cache on; data cache on, copyback mode.

Timer Source:         VMEchip2 Tick Timer 1
GCC Flags:            -m68040 -g -O4 -fomit-frame-pointer
Console:              Operate in polled mode. Set CD2401_POLLED_IO to 1 in
                      rtems/c/src/lib/libbsp/m68k/mvme167/console/console.c.     


Test Results
------------

Single processor tests:  All tests passed, except the following ones:
  sp19 and rtmonuse failed with an unimplemented floating point instruction
  exception (FCMP.X FP0,FP2). We do not have a floating point emulation
  library at this time.
  cpuuse and malloctest did not work.
  The stackchk test got an access fault exception before the RTEMS stack
  checker had had a chance to detect the corrupted stack.
                         
Multi-processort tests:  not applicable -- No MPCI layer yet.
