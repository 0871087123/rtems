2008-03-03	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/linkcmds, startup/linkcmdsflash, startup/linkcmdsram: Add
	wildcard to gcc_except_table section so programs compiled with gcc
	4.3.x can link.

2007-12-14	Chris Johns <chrisj@rtems.org>

	* gdb-init: Make the first hb temporary.
	* network/network.c: Add support for reading the MAC address from
	the FEC if set by the boot monitor. dBug does not do this unless
	the network is used which is a shame.

2007-12-14	Chris Johns <chrisj@rtems.org>

	* gdb-init: Add the show-exception.

2007-12-11	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* include/bsp.h, startup/bspstart.c: Eliminate copies of the
	Configuration Table. Use the RTEMS provided accessor macros to obtain
	configuration fields.

2007-12-04	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/bspstart.c: Move interrupt_stack_size field from CPU Table to
	Configuration Table. Eliminate CPU Table from all ports. Delete
	references to CPU Table in all forms.

2007-12-03	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* Makefile.am, startup/bspstart.c: Moved most of the remaining CPU
	Table fields to the Configuration Table. This included
	pretasking_hook, predriver_hook, postdriver_hook, idle_task,
	do_zero_of_workspace, extra_mpci_receive_server_stack,
	stack_allocate_hook, and stack_free_hook. As a side-effect of this
	effort some multiprocessing code was made conditional and some style
	clean up occurred.

2007-12-03	Chris Johns <chrisj@rtems.org>

	* console/console.c: Set the baud rate for stdin to 19200 when
	opening the console. This is the default rate for the dbug
	monitor.
	* gdb-init: New.

2007-11-26	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@oarcorp.com>

	* startup/bspstart.c: Eliminate the interrupt_vector_table field in the
	m68k CPU Table since it is never read.

2007-05-03	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/linkcmds: Handle .data.* sections

2007-04-12	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* bsp_specs: Remove qrtems_debug.

2007-03-12	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* include/coverhd.h, start/start.S, startup/bspclean.c,
	startup/bspstart.c, startup/linkcmds, startup/linkcmdsflash,
	startup/linkcmdsram: Correct license URL and/or fix mistake in
	copyright notice. Both of these mistakes appear to be from code
	submitted after these changes were made previously.

2007-03-11	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/bspstart.c: Remove assignments of
	Cpu_table.do_zero_of_workspace to TRUE since TRUE is the default
	value in boot_card.c

2007-03-10	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	PR 1227/bsps
	* include/bsp.h: Remove MAX_LONG_TEST_DURATION and
	MAX_SHORT_TEST_DURATION. They are obsolete and unused.

2006-12-15	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* network/network.c: Use ioctl_command_t as arg in ioctl-functions.

2006-12-02	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* configure.ac: New BUG-REPORT address.

2006-11-15	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* Makefile.am: Merge c_rtems_main() into boot_card(). This eliminated a
	file and simplified initialization.

2006-10-17	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* Makefile.am: Remove superfluous -DASM.

2006-10-17	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* configure.ac: Require autoconf-2.60. Require automake-1.10.

2006-09-11	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* console/console.c, startup/init5235.c: Convert C++ style comments to
	C style.

2006-06-23	Worth Burruss <worth@motioncontrol.org>

	* Makefile.am, README, startup/init5235.c, startup/linkcmds,
	startup/linkcmdsflash, startup/linkcmdsram: Modify to the mcf5235
	eval boards to either load and run from ram using the dBug moniter as
	the boot deviced (Board setup as shipped from the factory), or it
	allows the user to Boot his code from flash he loads onto the eval
	board. The code changes between the two are based on the selected
	linker script using a variable in the script.  The options to the
	linker are used to override the default linker script and select
	which options to configure at boot either from flash, or from ram:
            -qnolinkcmds -T linkcmdsflash
	If no options are given the standard linker sript assumes dBug was
	used to set up the board and the user is going to load his program
	to RAM.

2006-02-08	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/linkcmds, startup/linkcmdsflash, startup/linkcmdsram: Add
	sections required by newer gcc versions.

2006-01-11	Ralf Corsepius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* Makefile.am: Add preinstall.am.

2005-11-07	Ralf Corsepius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* console/console.c: Eliminate unsigned32, unsigned8.
	* include/bsp.h: Eliminate unsigned32.
	* startup/bspstart.c: Eliminate unsigned32.

2005-06-17	Mike Bertosh <mbertosh@motioncontrol.org>

	* .cvsignore, ChangeLog, Makefile.am, README, bsp_specs, configure.ac,
	clock/clock.c, console/console.c, include/bsp.h, include/coverhd.h,
	include/tm27.h, network/network.c, start/start.S, startup/bspclean.c,
	startup/bspstart.c, startup/init5235.c, startup/linkcmds,
	startup/linkcmdsflash, startup/linkcmdsram, timer/timer.c: New files.
