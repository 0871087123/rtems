	* console/console.c, startup/init5235.c: Convert C++ style comments to

	* Makefile.am, README, startup/init5235.c, startup/linkcmds,
	startup/linkcmdsflash, startup/linkcmdsram: Modify to the mcf5235
	eval boards to either load and run from ram using the dBug moniter as
	the boot deviced (Board setup as shipped from the factory), or it
	allows the user to Boot his code from flash he loads onto the eval
	board. The code changes between the two are based on the selected
	linker script using a variable in the script.  The options to the
	linker are used to override the default linker script and select
	which options to configure at boot either from flash, or from ram:
            -qnolinkcmds -T linkcmdsflash
	If no options are given the standard linker sript assumes dBug was
	used to set up the board and the user is going to load his program
	to RAM.
