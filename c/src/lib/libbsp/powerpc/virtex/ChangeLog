	* README, include/bsp.h, startup/bspstart.c: Eliminate copies of the
	Configuration Table. Use the RTEMS provided accessor macros to obtain
	configuration fields.

2007-12-10	Till Straumann <strauman@slac.stanford.edu>

	* irq/irq_init.c:
	renamed ASM_BOOKE_PIT_VECTOR to ASM_BOOKE_DEC_VECTOR
	to be closer to 'official' nomenclature.

2007-12-04	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* include/bsp.h, startup/bspstart.c: Move interrupt_stack_size field
	from CPU Table to Configuration Table. Eliminate CPU Table from all
	ports. Delete references to CPU Table in all forms.

2007-12-03	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/bspstart.c: Moved most of the remaining CPU Table fields to
	the Configuration Table. This included pretasking_hook,
	predriver_hook, postdriver_hook, idle_task, do_zero_of_workspace,
	extra_mpci_receive_server_stack, stack_allocate_hook, and
	stack_free_hook. As a side-effect of this effort some multiprocessing
	code was made conditional and some style clean up occurred.

2007-11-30	Till Straumann <strauman@slac.stanford.edu>

	* startup/bspstart.c: removed bsp_exceptions_in_RAM

2007-11-30	Till Straumann <strauman@slac.stanford.edu>

	* irq/irq.h, irq/irq_init.c: Removed the definition
	of ASM_IRQ_VECTOR_BASE; this symbol was only use to
	initialize the irqBase member of the rtems_irq_global_settings
	struct. However, irqBase is an rtems_irq_symbolic_name,
	so using BSP_LOWEST_OFFSET is more appropriate.

2007-11-28	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/bspstart.c: Now compiles and links.

2007-11-28	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/bspstart.c: Eliminate PowerPC specific elements from the CPU
	Table. They have been replaced with variables named bsp_XXX as
	needed.

2007-11-07	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* aclocal.m4: Removed. Is automatically generated by bootstrap.

2007-10-02	Jukka Pietarinen <jukka.pietarinen@mrf.fi>

	* startup/linkcmds: Move definition of _end so memory is not corrupted.

2007-09-12	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	PR 1257/bsps
	* irq/irq_init.c: Code outside of cpukit should use the public API for
	rtems_interrupt_disable/rtems_interrupt_enable. By bypassing the
	public API and directly accessing _CPU_ISR_Disable and
	_CPU_ISR_Enable, they were bypassing the compiler memory barrier
	directive which could lead to problems. This patch also changes the
	type of the variable passed into these routines and addresses minor
	style issues.

2007-09-11      Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* Makefile.am, include/bsp.h: Do not include networking
	drivers if networking is disabled.

2007-09-10	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* network/xiltemac.c: Remove duplicate prototype.

2007-08-09	Thomas Doerfler <Thomas.Doerfler@embedded-brains.de>
	* network/xiltemac.c:
	applied patch from Robert Grimes to correctly set the link speed
	to 100MBit

2007-07-27	Thomas Doerfler <Thomas.Doerfler@embedded-brains.de>

	* linkcmds: removed superfluous bss section

2007-07-27	Thomas Doerfler <Thomas.Doerfler@embedded-brains.de>

	* autom4te.cache/, network.old/: Removed.

2007-07-10	Thomas Doerfler <Thomas.Doerfler@embedded-brains.de>

	* startup/linkcmds.dl: Removed.

2007-07-05	Thomas Doerfler <Thomas.Doerfler@embedded-brains.de>

	* include/bsp.h: Added bsp/vectors.h and bsp/irq.h to list of
	included headers.

2007-07-05	Thomas Doerfler <Thomas.Doerfler@embedded-brains.de>

	* opbintctrl/opbintctrl.c: Removed obsolete code.

2007-07-05	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@oarcorp.com>

	* .cvsignore: New file.
