Board description
-----------------
clock rate:	234 MHz
ROM:		16MByte FLASH
RAM:		64MByte DRAM

gen405 only supports single processor operations.

Porting
-------
This board support package is written for a typical PPC405GP
system. The rough features of this board are described above.


For adapting this BSP to other boards, the following files should be
modified:

- c/src/lib/libbsp/powerpc/gen405/startup/linkcmds
	for the memory layout required

- c/src/lib/libbsp/powerpc/gen405/startup/bspstart.c
	for adaption of BSP_Configuration. here you can select
	the clock source for the timers and the serial interface
	(system clock or external clock pin), the clock rates, initial
	baud rate and other stuff

- c/src/lib/libbsp/powerpc/gen405/include/bsp.h
	some BSP-related constants

The actual drivers are placed in 
- c/src/lib/libcpu/powerpc/ppc403/*
	well, they should be generic, so there _should_ be no reason
	to mess around there (but who knows...)
