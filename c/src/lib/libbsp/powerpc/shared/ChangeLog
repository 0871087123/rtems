 	* start/start.S: Increased BAT0 mapping of RAM from 64 meg to
	256 meg to allow operation on boards with larger RAM sizes.
	* vectors/vectors_init.c: Modified to call 'generic' powerpc
	vector function (mpc60x_vector_is_valid) instead of MPC750 
	specific function to allow operation on boards with CPUs other
	than the MPC750.

	* Makefile.am, console/consoleIo.h, include/bsp.h:
	These modifications are part of the conversion of the
	mpc8xx CPU to the "new exception processing model."

	* startup/bspstart.c: assoc.h, error.h, libio_.h, libio.h,
	and libcsupport.h moved from libc to lib/include/rtems and
	now must be referenced as <rtems/XXX.h>.   Header file order
	was cleaned up while doing this.

2000-09-29	Charles-Antoine Gauthier <charles.gauthier@nrc.ca>

	* startup/linkcmds: Added lines so DWARF debug information
	would be available.  Otherwise gdb complains that the offsets
	for the debug info are incorrect and doesn't load the files.

	* start/start.S: Include proper files to compile.

2000-08-10	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* ChangeLog: New file.
