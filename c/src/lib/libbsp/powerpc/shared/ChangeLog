	PR 428/bsps
	PR 432/bsps
	* bootloader/pci.c: Re-instated code that prevents remapping small
	IO regions, which if remapped would cause i8259 registers to move
	out from under the #define'd base addresses.
	* startup/bspstart.c: Reduced BAT2 PCI memory allocation to 256
	megs, I incorrectly had extended it which would cause problems with
	PCI devices that defined prefetchable memory.

	PR 405/bsps
	* bootloader/pci.c: Added support for configuring devices for pci
	busses > 0
	* pci/pci.c, pci/pci.h: Added FixupPCI() to store vectors in the
	INTERRUPT_LINE register of pci devices any # of hops away
	from the host processor.
	* motorola/motorola.c, motorola/motorola.h: Added interrupt
	routing tables in support of FixupPCI.  This is board-specific,
	each board will have to supply information for FixupPCI() to do
	anything for it.
	* startup/bspstart.c: Extended bat2 to cover entire PCI address space.
	* irq/irq.c, irq/irq.h: Added support for shared interrupts.
	Existing single hander vectors are undisturbed, a new function
	added to allow adding/removing handlers from a vector.

2003-06-13  Till Straumann <strauman@slac.stanford.edu>

	PR 415/bsps
	* include/bsp.h, pci/detect_raven_bridge.c, startup/bspstart.c:
	Support enabling MCP exceptions on the host bridge. This can
	be used for memory probing on the VME bus.

2003-04-15	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	PR 386/bsps
	* vme/vmeconfig.c: Removed declaration of _BSP_vme_bridge_irq.

2003-04-10  Till Straumann <strauman@slac.stanford.edu>

	PR 379/bsps
	* console/polled_io.c: libcpu provides 'printk' already.
	Therefore, the implementation in this file was removed (still
	used for the bootloader, though).  It now provides BSP_output_char()
	for libcpu's printk().
	* console/uart.c, console/uart.h: BSP_output_char_via_serial()
	prototype changed to match the BSP_output_char_function_type.  Note
	that the motorola BSPs use polled-io for the output_char routine, not
	the uart.c version. The latter can be used be other BSPs however
	(e.g. SVGM).
	* console/console.c, console/consoleIo.h, console/polled_io.c,
	irq/irq_init.c, openpic/openpic.c, pci/detect_raven_bridge.c:
	Unfortunately, the supported 'printk' format string subset of the
	polled-io and libcpu implementations are different - hence, a few
	format strings in the ppc/shared BSP were changed.

2003-04-10	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	PR 383/bsps
	* irq/irq.c: Fix bug introduced by conflicts in previous patches.

2003-03-25  Till Straumann <strauman@slac.stanford.edu>

	PR 360/bsps
	* irq/irq.c, irq/irq_init.c, openpic/openpic.c, openpic/openpic.h:
	BSP code had set the task priority register multiple times of
	the OpenPIC instead of setting the individual source priorities.
	This patch adds openpic_get_source_priority() and
	openpic_set_source_priority() calls and lets IRQ management code
	use them.

2003-03-25  Till Straumann <strauman@slac.stanford.edu>

	PR 349/bsps
	* irq/irq.c, vme/VME.h, vme/vmeconfig.c: Fixes library dependency
	on the vmeUniverse driver. It is now possible to use the ppc/shared/irq
	code on non-VME BSPs without triggering linkage of the vmeUniverse
	driver.

2003-03-18  Till Straumann <strauman@slac.stanford.edu>

	PR 356/bsps
	This patch makes RTEMS/powerpc/shared EABI compliant.
	* irq/irq_init.c, start/Makefile.am, start/start.S, startup/bspstart.c,
	startup/pgtbl_setup.c, vectors/vectors.h, vectors/vectors_init.c:
	zero_bss() should clear not only bss but sbss and sbss2
	also (this is probably a bugfix, as sbss/sbss2 are
	probably used even if -msdata=eabi is not specified).
	* start/rtems_crti.S: New file which must
	be linked immediately after ecrti.o. rtems_crti.o contains
	a code snippet who lets __init() return immediately. Also,
	a new entry point '_init' to the C++ Ctors is generated
	for use by the RTEMS Thread_Handler.

	PR 349/bsps
	* console/polled_io.c, console/reboot.c, irq/irq.c, irq/irq_asm.S,
	irq/irq_init.c, openpic/Makefile.am, startup/linkcmds,
	vectors/vectors.S, vectors/vectors_init.c:
	  - install the 'openpic.h' and 'pci.h' headers 
	  - avoid a name clash by renaming 'vsprintf' & friends
	    to 'k_vsprintf' etc.
	  - let 'rtemsReboot' print a stack trace (in case an 'assert' failed)
	  - irq.c:
	     * fix: remove implicit assumption that ISA interrupt vectors start
	            at 0
	     * add BSP hook to let a VME interrupt acknowledge the PCI/openpic
	       IRQ. (SEE ALSO THE ppc-sharedbsp-vme.diff patch)
	  - fix: EABI compliance; isr/exception lowlevel handlers must not
	         clobber R2 or R13
	  - fix: openpic_init was called with the polarity/senses tables
	         swapped (fixed wrong order of arguments)
	  - cosmetics: use new _read_SPRXX() _write_SPRXX() macros

2003-02-20	Till Straumann <strauman@slac.stanford.edu>

	PR 349/bsps
	* startup/pgtbl_setup.c, startup/pgtbl_activate.c: New files
	* startup/Makefile.am, startup/bspstart.c, startup/linkcmds:
	Let the powerpc/shared (+derived) BSPs use pagetable support
   	from libcpu.

2003-02-20	Till Straumann <strauman@slac.stanford.edu>

	PR 349/bsps
	* vme/.cvsignore, vme/Makefile.am, vme/VME.h, vme/VMEConfig.h,
	vme/vmeconfig.c: Add glue to the powerpc/shared BSP to use
	the vmeUniverse VME-PCI bridge driver.

2003-02-20	Till Straumann <strauman@slac.stanford.edu>

	PR 349/bsps
	* console/console.c, console/uart.c, console/uart.h: implement
	IOCTLs for the serial (UART) console to install/retrieve a BREAK-IRQ
	callback.  The callback routine (if installed) is invoked from the
	UART ISR when a BREAK interrupt is detected.  This can be used
	e.g. to enforce a "hotkey" reboot a la vxWorks Ctrl-X (although we
	use the serial line break condition) NOTE: The callback runs in
	ISR context.  

2003-01-20	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/linkcmds*: Add FreeBSD sysctl() sections.

2002-12-08	Greg Menke <gregory.menke@gsfc.nasa.gov>
  
	* bootloader/head.S: Added support for optional debug via PPCbug.
	Also turn off mmu/caches for the bootstrap phase, which seems to
	cause trouble with the 603.  The cpu init functions in the bsp
	get all that stuff going properly.

2002-12-19	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* console/console.c: Removed __assert() which conflicts with newlib.

2002-11-17	Greg Menke <gregory.menke@gsfc.nasa.gov>

	Per PR216, "libbsp/powerpc/shared" BSP has been modified considerably
	with the goal to make it more flexible and reusable by other
	BSPs. The main strategies were:
	    - eliminate hardcoded base addresses; devices use offsets
	      and a BSP defined base address.
	    - separate functionality into different files (e.g. reboot from
	      inch.c to reboot.c) which can be overridden by a 'derived' BSP.
	    - separate initialization code into separate files (e.g.  PCI
	      bridge detection/initialization was separated from the more
	      generic PCI access routines), also to make it easier for
	      'derived' BSPs to substitute their own initialization code.
	There are also a couple of enhancements and fixes:
	    - IRQ handling code now has a hook for attaching a VME bridge.
	    - OpenPIC is now explicitely initialized (polarities, senses).
	      Eliminated the implicit assumption on the presence of an ISA PIC.
	    - UART and console driver now supports more than 1 port. The current
	      maximum of 2 can easily be extended by enlarging a table (it
	      would even be easier if the ISR API was not broken by design).
	    - fixed polled_io.c so it correctly supports console on COM2
	    - fixed TLB invalidation code (start.S).
	    - exception handler prints a stack backtrace.
	    - added BSP_pciFindDevice() to scan the pci bus for a particular
	      vendor/device/instance.

2001-05-09	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/linkcmds: In support of gcc 3.1, added one of more
	of the sections .jcr, .rodata*, .data.*, .gnu.linkonce.s2.*,
	.gnu.linkonce.sb2.*, and .gnu.linkonce.s.*.  Spacing corrections
	and direction of segments to memory regions may also have been
	addressed.  This was a sweep across all BSPs.

2001-03-30	Eric Valette <valette@crf.canon.fr>

	* Makefile.am, console/consoleIo.h, include/bsp.h:
	These modifications are part of the conversion of the
	mpc8xx CPU to the "new exception processing model."

2000-11-01	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/bspstart.c: assoc.h, error.h, libio_.h, libio.h,

	was cleaned up while doing this.

2000-09-29	Charles-Antoine Gauthier <charles.gauthier@nrc.ca>
