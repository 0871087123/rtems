/*  set_vector
 *
 *  This routine installs an interrupt vector on the target Board/CPU.
 *  This routine is allowed to be as board dependent as necessary.
 *
 *  INPUT:
 *    handler - interrupt handler entry point
 *    vector  - vector number
 *    type    - 0 indicates raw hardware connect
 *              1 indicates RTEMS interrupt connect
 *
 *  RETURNS:
 *    address of previous interrupt handler
