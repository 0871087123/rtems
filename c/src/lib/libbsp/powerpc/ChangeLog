2006-03-08	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* shared/startup/linkcmds: Add .gnu.linkonce.b.* section.

2006-02-13	Till Straumann <strauman@slac.stanford.edu>
	* shared/startup/panic.c, shared/startup/probeMemEnd.c:
    added code for BSPs to use: panic using printk() to display
    reason. probeMemEnd() to determine memory size by probing.

2006-02-08	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* shared/startup/linkcmds: Add sections required by newer gcc versions.

2006-01-08	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* acinclude.m4: Add gen5200 to list of BSPs.

2006-01-05	Till Straumann <strauman@slac.stanford.edu>
	* shared/vectors/vectors.S: mask high bits when calculating
	the exception vector number to yield correct result even if
	the vectors reside in the upper area (0xfff00000; psim).

2005-12-02	Till Straumann <strauman@slac.stanford.edu>
	* shared/irq/irq_init.c, shared/openpic/openpic.h
        shared/openpic/openpic.c: The 8240's EPIC has a 'serial'
        mode of operation for multiplexing 16 interrupt lines.
        This introduces a pipeline delay which can cause
        spurious interrupts unless ending the interrupt cycle
        (EOI) is delayed accordingly.

2005-12-01	Till Straumann <strauman@slac.stanford.edu>
	* shared/vectors/vectors.h, shared/vectors/vectors.S,
        shared/vectors/vectors_init.c: Reduced size of default
        prologue (some exceptions, e.g., altivec unavail.) are only
        0x20 bytes apart. Also introduced a modified prologue
        that switches r0..r3 shadowing off (r0..r3 undefined
        on certain 603e variants when incurring a TLB miss).

2005-11-29	Till Straumann <strauman@slac.stanford.edu>
	* shared/irq/irq_asm.S, shared/vectors/vectors.S: Clear
        CR[6] before invoking high-level handler to make sure no
        varargs fn callee assumes there are FP arguments.

2005-11-29	Till Straumann <strauman@slac.stanford.edu>
	* shared/irq/irq.c: Fixed incorrect removal of first shared
        interrupt in chain.

2005-11-09	Ralf Corsepius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* shared/startup/bspstart.c: Eliminate obsolete types.

	mvme5500/start/preload.S, mvme5500/startup/bspstart.c,
	shared/startup/bspstart.c: moved linkcmds to shared area for other
	BSPs to use

2005-11-03	Till Straumann <strauman@slac.stanford.edu>

	* shared/bootloader/misc.c, shared/console/polled_io.c,
	shared/residual/residual.c: silenced compiler warnings (type cast &
	renaming puts->my_puts)

2005-11-02	Till Straumann <strauman@slac.stanford.edu>

	* mvme5500/start/start.S, shared/start/start.S,
	shared/startup/bspstart.c: moved assembly code to C; setdbat now
	supports high bats on 7450 CPUs; added argument checking to setdbat;
	added getdbat; moved early initialization code (clear_bats) from BSP
	to libcpu (CPU_clear_bats_early)

	* configure.ac: Remove shared/Makefile.am.
	* ChangeLog: Merge-in shared/ChangeLog.

2005-10-06	Till Straumann <strauman@slac.stanford.edu>

	PR 833/bsps
	* shared/irq/irq_asm.S: Currently, all (new exception) BSPs
	explicitely enable the FPU across the user ISR but DONT save/restore
	the FPU context. Any use of the FPU fron the user handler (e.g., due
	to GCC optimizations) result in corruption. The fix results in an
	exception in such cases (user ISR must explicitely
	save/enable/restore FPU).

2005-09-16	richard.campbell@OARCorp.com

	* shared/startup/bspstart.c: Rewrote get_eumbbar() in C. Function
	was written in inline assembly and containined a register direction
	error.

2005-07-28	Eric Norum <norume@aps.anl.gov>

	* shared/shared/clock/p_clock.c: Changes provided by Phillip
	Sorensen <pas37@cornell.edu> to get MVME550 BSP running.

2004-11-30	Greg Menke <gregory.menke@gsfc.nasa.gov>

	PR 729/bsps
	PR 728/bsps
	* shared/bootloader/ppcboot.lds: Modified ppcboot.lds to include new
	.data and .rodata sections being generated by gcc-3.3.3 and above,
	the lack of which was causing the bootloader to crash.
	* shared/bootloader/pci.c: Removed the r->size=0 and r->base=0
	assignement which makes too-large regions conflict with onboard
	hardware, replacing it with sfree which deletes the memory region
	from the setup code, leaving it disabled.

2004-11-30	Eric Norum <norume@aps.anl.gov>

	* mvme5500/include/bsp.h: Add definition for PCI_MEM_BASE_ADJUSTMENT

2004-09-27	Greg Menke <gregory.menke@gsfc.nasa.gov>

	PR 606/bsps
	* shared/bootloader/pci.c, shared/bootloader/pci.c: Fixed IO
	remapping so buses >= 1 are remapped. Reduced PCI space to match
	bat2.  Fixed incorrect region size calculation in pci_read_bases. 
	Set PCI latency timers to known sane values.  Changed bridge PCI
	settings to minimum sane instead of whatever sounded neat in the PCI
	spec.  Force pf regions to memory mapped to preserve byte access.

2004-09-24	Ralf Corsepius <ralf_corsepius@rtems.org>

	* configure.ac: Require automake > 1.9.

2004-04-13	Ralf Corsepius <ralf_corsepius@rtems.org>

	address.

2003-07-18	Till Straumann <strauman@slac.stanford.edu>

	PR 288/rtems
	* support/new_exception_processing/cpu.c: _ISR_Nest_level is now
	properly maintained and does not reside in SPRG0.

2003-07-16	Greg Menke <gregory.menke@gsfc.nasa.gov>

	PR 432/bsps
	* shared/bootloader/pci.c: Re-instated code that prevents remapping
	small IO regions, which if remapped would cause i8259 registers to
	move out from under the #define'd base addresses.
	* shared/startup/bspstart.c: Reduced BAT2 PCI memory allocation to
	256 megs, I incorrectly had extended it which would cause problems
	with PCI devices that defined prefetchable memory.

2003-06-13	Till Straumann <strauman@slac.stanford.edu>

	PR 415/bsps
	* shared/include/bsp.h, shared/pci/detect_raven_bridge.c,
	shared/startup/bspstart.c: Support enabling MCP exceptions on the
	host bridge. This can be used for memory probing on the VME bus.

2003-06-13	Greg Menke <gregory.menke@gsfc.nasa.gov>

	PR 405/bsps
	* shared/irq/irq.c, shared/irq/irq.h: Added support for shared
	interrupts. Existing single hander vectors are undisturbed, a new
	function added to allow adding/removing handlers from a vector.
	* shared/bootloader/pci.c: Added support for configuring devices for
	pci busses > 0
	* shared/motorola/motorola.c, shared/motorola/motorola.h: Added
	interrupt routing tables in support of FixupPCI.  This is
	board-specific, each board will have to supply information for
	FixupPCI() to do anything for it.
	* shared/startup/bspstart.c: Extended bat2 to cover entire PCI
	address space.
	* shared/pci/pci.c, shared/pci/pci.h: Added FixupPCI() to store
	vectors in the INTERRUPT_LINE register of pci devices any # of hops
	away from the host processor.

2003-04-15	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	PR 386/bsps
	* shared/vme/vmeconfig.c, shared/vme/vmeconfig.c: Removed
	declaration of _BSP_vme_bridge_irq.

2003-04-10	Till Straumann <strauman@slac.stanford.edu>

	PR 379/bsps
	* shared/console/console.c, shared/console/consoleIo.h,
	shared/console/polled_io.c, shared/irq/irq_init.c,
	shared/openpic/openpic.c, shared/pci/detect_raven_bridge.c:
	Unfortunately, the supported 'printk' format string subset of the
	polled-io and libcpu implementations are different - hence, a few
	format strings in the ppc/shared BSP were changed.
	* shared/console/uart.c, shared/console/uart.h:
	BSP_output_char_via_serial() prototype changed to match the
	BSP_output_char_function_type.  Note that the motorola BSPs use
	polled-io for the output_char routine, not the uart.c version. The
	latter can be used be other BSPs however (e.g. SVGM).
	* shared/console/polled_io.c: libcpu provides 'printk' already.
	Therefore, the implementation in this file was removed (still used
	for the bootloader, though).  It now provides BSP_output_char() for
	libcpu's printk().

2003-04-10	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	PR 383/bsps
	* shared/irq/irq.c: Fix bug introduced by conflicts in previous
	patches.

2003-03-25	Till Straumann <strauman@slac.stanford.edu>

	PR 360/bsps
	PR 349/bsps
	* shared/irq/irq.c, shared/vme/VME.h, shared/vme/vmeconfig.c,
	shared/irq/irq.c, shared/vme/VME.h, shared/vme/vmeconfig.c,
	shared/irq/irq.c, shared/vme/VME.h, shared/vme/vmeconfig.c: Fixes
	library dependency on the vmeUniverse driver. It is now possible to
	use the ppc/shared/irq code on non-VME BSPs without triggering
	linkage of the vmeUniverse driver.
	* shared/irq/irq.c, shared/irq/irq_init.c, shared/openpic/openpic.c,
	shared/openpic/openpic.h: BSP code had set the task priority
	register multiple times of the OpenPIC instead of setting the
	individual source priorities. This patch adds
	openpic_get_source_priority() and openpic_set_source_priority()
	calls and lets IRQ management code use them.

2003-03-18	Till Straumann <strauman@slac.stanford.edu>

	PR 356/bsps
	This patch makes RTEMS/powerpc/shared EABI compliant.
	* shared/irq/irq_init.c, shared/start/Makefile.am,
	shared/start/start.S, shared/startup/bspstart.c,
	shared/startup/pgtbl_setup.c, shared/vectors/vectors.h,
	shared/vectors/vectors_init.c: zero_bss() should clear not only bss
	but sbss and sbss2 also (this is probably a bugfix, as sbss/sbss2
	are probably used even if -msdata=eabi is not specified).
	* shared/start/rtems_crti.S: New file which must be linked
	immediately after ecrti.o. rtems_crti.o contains a code snippet who
	lets __init() return immediately. Also, a new entry point '_init' to
	the C++ Ctors is generated for use by the RTEMS Thread_Handler.

2003-03-06	Ralf Corsepius <corsepiu@faw.uni-ulm.de>

	* configure.ac: Remove AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR.

2003-02-20	Till Straumann <strauman@slac.stanford.edu>

	PR 349/bsps
	* shared/console/console.c, shared/console/uart.c,
	shared/console/uart.h: implement IOCTLs for the serial (UART)
	console to install/retrieve a BREAK-IRQ callback.  The callback
	routine (if installed) is invoked from the UART ISR when a BREAK
	interrupt is detected.  This can be used e.g. to enforce a "hotkey"
	reboot a la vxWorks Ctrl-X (although we use the serial line break
	condition) NOTE: The callback runs in ISR context.
	* shared/startup/pgtbl_setup.c, shared/startup/pgtbl_activate.c: New
	files
	* shared/add BSP hook to let a VME interrupt acknowledge the
	PCI/openpic IRQ. (SEE ALSO THE ppc-sharedbsp-vme.diff patch) - fix:
	EABI compliance; isr/exception lowlevel handlers must not clobber R2
	or R13 - fix: openpic_init was called with the polarity/senses
	tables swapped (fixed wrong order of arguments) - cosmetics: use new
	_read_SPRXX() _write_SPRXX() macros
	* shared/fix: remove implicit assumption that ISA interrupt vectors
	start at 0
	* configure.ac, shared/vme/.cvsignore, shared/vme/Makefile.am,
	shared/vme/VME.h, shared/vme/VMEConfig.h, shared/vme/vmeconfig.c:
	Add glue to the powerpc/shared BSP to use the vmeUniverse VME-PCI
	bridge driver.
	* shared/console/polled_io.c, shared/console/reboot.c,
	shared/irq/irq.c, shared/irq/irq_asm.S, shared/irq/irq_init.c,
	shared/openpic/Makefile.am, shared/startup/linkcmds,
	shared/vectors/vectors.S, shared/vectors/vectors_init.c: - install
	the 'openpic.h' and 'pci.h' headers  - avoid a name clash by
	renaming 'vsprintf' & friends to 'k_vsprintf' etc. - let
	'rtemsReboot' print a stack trace (in case an 'assert' failed) -
	irq.c:
	* shared/startup/Makefile.am, shared/startup/bspstart.c,
	shared/startup/linkcmds: Let the powerpc/shared (+derived) BSPs use
	pagetable support from libcpu.

2003-02-11	Ralf Corsepius <corsepiu@faw.uni-ulm.de>

	* configure.ac: AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE([1.7.2]).

2002-12-08	Greg Menke <gregory.menke@gsfc.nasa.gov>

	* shared/bootloader/head.S: Added support for optional debug via
	PPCbug. Also turn off mmu/caches for the bootstrap phase, which
	seems to cause trouble with the 603.  The cpu init functions in the
	bsp get all that stuff going properly.

2002-12-06	Ralf Corsepius <corsepiu@faw.uni-ulm.de>

	This modification is part of the submitted modifications necessary
	to
	support the IBM PPC405 family.  This submission was reviewed by
	Thomas Doerfler <Thomas.Doerfler@imd-systems.de> who ensured it did
	not negatively impact the ppc403 BSPs.  The submission and tracking
	process was captured as PR50.
	* ChangeLog: Removed bogus comment on edit of generated file.
	* acinclude.m4: Added gen405 BSP.

2001-10-25	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* shared/startup/linkcmds: Added _init and _fini.

	shared/irq/Makefile.am, shared/motorola/Makefile.am,
	shared/vectors/Makefile.am, shared/pci/Makefile.am,
	shared/openpic/Makefile.am: Use 'PREINSTALL_FILES ='.

2001-05-14	Tom Armistead <tom_armistead@phx.mcd.mot.com>

	* shared/start/start.S: Increased BAT0 mapping of RAM from 64 meg to
	256 meg to allow operation on boards with larger RAM sizes.
	* shared/vectors/vectors_init.c: Modified to call 'generic' powerpc
	vector function (mpc60x_vector_is_valid) instead of MPC750  specific
	function to allow operation on boards with CPUs other than the
	MPC750.

	shared/vectors/vectors.h, shared/vectors/vectors_init.c: Per PR216,
	"libbsp/powerpc/shared" BSP has been modified considerably with the
	goal to make it more flexible and reusable by other BSPs. The main
	strategies were: - eliminate hardcoded base addresses; devices use
	offsets and a BSP defined base address. - separate functionality
	into different files (e.g. reboot from inch.c to reboot.c) which can
	be overridden by a 'derived' BSP. - separate initialization code
	into separate files (e.g.  PCI bridge detection/initialization was
	separated from the more generic PCI access routines), also to make
	it easier for 'derived' BSPs to substitute their own initialization
	code. There are also a couple of enhancements and fixes: - IRQ
	handling code now has a hook for attaching a VME bridge. - OpenPIC
	is now explicitely initialized (polarities, senses). Eliminated the
	implicit assumption on the presence of an ISA PIC. - UART and
	console driver now supports more than 1 port. The current maximum of
	2 can easily be extended by enlarging a table (it would even be
	easier if the ISR API was not broken by design). - fixed polled_io.c
	so it correctly supports console on COM2 - fixed TLB invalidation
	code (start.S). - exception handler prints a stack backtrace. -
	added BSP_pciFindDevice() to scan the pci bus for a particular
	vendor/device/instance.

2001-05-09	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* shared/startup/linkcmds: In support of gcc 3.1, added one of more
	of the sections .jcr, .rodata*, .data.*, .gnu.linkonce.s2.*,
	.gnu.linkonce.sb2.*, and .gnu.linkonce.s.*.  Spacing corrections and
	direction of segments to memory regions may also have been
	addressed.  This was a sweep across all BSPs.

2001-04-08	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* shared/startup/linkcmds: Per PR170, PR171, and PR172 add .eh_frame

2001-03-30	Eric Valette <valette@crf.canon.fr>

	* shared/Makefile.am, shared/console/consoleIo.h,
	shared/include/bsp.h: These modifications are part of the conversion
	of the mpc8xx CPU to the "new exception processing model."
	* configure.in, motorola_powerpc/Makefile.am,
	motorola_powerpc/configure.in: These modifications are in support of
	switching the mpc8xx to the use the "new exception processing
	model."

2000-11-09	Ralf Corsepius <corsepiu@faw.uni-ulm.de>

	* Makefile.am: Use ... instead of RTEMS_TOPdir in ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS.

2000-11-02	Ralf Corsepius <corsepiu@faw.uni-ulm.de>

	* Makefile.am: Switch to ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS = -I
	$(RTEMS_TOPdir)/aclocal.

2000-11-01	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* shared/startup/bspstart.c: assoc.h, error.h, libio_.h, libio.h,
	and libcsupport.h moved from libc to lib/include/rtems and now must
	be referenced as <rtems/XXX.h>.   Header file order was cleaned up
	while doing this.

2000-10-27	Ralf Corsepius <corsepiu@faw.uni-ulm.de>

	* Makefile.am: ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS= -I $(RTEMS_TOPdir)/macros. Switch to
	GNU canonicalization.

2000-09-29	Charles-Antoine Gauthier <charles.gauthier@nrc.ca>

	* shared/startup/linkcmds: Added lines so DWARF debug information
	would be available.  Otherwise gdb complains that the offsets for
	the debug info are incorrect and doesn't load the files.

2000-09-05	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* shared/start/start.S: Include proper files to compile.

2000-08-10	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* ChangeLog, shared/ChangeLog: New file.
