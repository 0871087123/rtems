	* startup/bspstart.c: Move interrupt_stack_size field from CPU Table to
	Configuration Table. Eliminate CPU Table from all ports. Delete
	references to CPU Table in all forms.

2007-12-04	Thomas Doerfler <Thomas.Doerfler@embedded-brains.de>

	* spi/spi_init.c: added missing file

2007-12-03	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* Makefile.am, startup/bspstart.c: Moved most of the remaining CPU
	Table fields to the Configuration Table. This included
	pretasking_hook, predriver_hook, postdriver_hook, idle_task,
	do_zero_of_workspace, extra_mpci_receive_server_stack,
	stack_allocate_hook, and stack_free_hook. As a side-effect of this
	effort some multiprocessing code was made conditional and some style
	clean up occurred.

2007-11-30	Till Straumann <strauman@slac.stanford.edu>

	* startup/bspstart: removed _Cpu_table.exceptions_in_RAM.

2007-11-30	Till Straumann <strauman@slac.stanford.edu>

	* irq/irq.h, irq/irq_init.c: Removed the definition
	of ASM_IRQ_VECTOR_BASE; this symbol was only use to
	initialize the irqBase member of the rtems_irq_global_settings
	struct. However, irqBase is an rtems_irq_symbolic_name,
	so using BSP_LOWEST_OFFSET is more appropriate.

2007-11-28	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/bspstart.c: Eliminate PowerPC specific elements from the CPU
	Table. They have been replaced with variables named bsp_XXX as
	needed.

2007-10-26	Thomas Doerfler <Thomas.Doerfler@embedded-brains.de>

	* startup/cpuinit.c: reenable instruction MMU

2007-10-26	Thomas Doerfler <Thomas.Doerfler@embedded-brains.de>

	* startup/bspstart.c, startup/linkcmds: 
	removed unneeded address definitions

2007-10-25	Thomas Doerfler <Thomas.Doerfler@embedded-brains.de>

	* include/bsp.h: fixed some typos

2007-10-25	Thomas Doerfler <Thomas.Doerfler@embedded-brains.de>

	* Makefile.am, spi/spi_init.c, include/bsp.h: add spi support

2007-09-17	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* console/console.c, irq/irq_init.c: Eliminate warnings.

2007-09-17	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* console/console.c: Eliminate DEBUG_puts.

2007-09-12	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	PR 1257/bsps
	* irq/irq_init.c: Code outside of cpukit should use the public API for
	rtems_interrupt_disable/rtems_interrupt_enable. By bypassing the
	public API and directly accessing _CPU_ISR_Disable and
	_CPU_ISR_Enable, they were bypassing the compiler memory barrier
	directive which could lead to problems. This patch also changes the
	type of the variable passed into these routines and addresses minor
	style issues.

2007-09-11	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* Makefile.am: Do not include networking drivers if networking is
	disabled.

2007-09-10	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

2007-07-13	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* Makefile.am, preinstall.am: Install a linkcmds all the time.
	* startup/bspstart.c, startup/cpuinit.c,
	startup/linkcmds.mpc8349eamds, startup/mpc83xx_regs.c: Add missing 
	CVS Id.
