2008-05-15	Thomas Doerfler <Thomas.Doerfler@embedded-brains.de>

	* network/network.c, start/start.S:
	add support for different board

2008-05-15	Thomas Doerfler <Thomas.Doerfler@embedded-brains.de>

	* irq/ipic.c:
	make sure, that the masking operations in 
	ICTL and MSR are executed in order

2008-05-15	Thomas Doerfler <Thomas.Doerfler@embedded-brains.de>

	* include/bsp.h, startup/bspstart.c, 
	* console/console.c, console/config.c:
	derived module input frequencies from internal bus clock during
	start time

2008-05-15	Thomas Doerfler <Thomas.Doerfler@embedded-brains.de>

	* spi/spi_init.c:
	added base frequency into softc structure, added fm25l256 driver

2008-05-15	Thomas Doerfler <Thomas.Doerfler@embedded-brains.de>

	* i2c/i2c_init.c:
	added base frequency into softc structure

2008-05-15	Thomas Doerfler <Thomas.Doerfler@embedded-brains.de>

	* include/bsp.h, include/hwreg_vals.h, ./Makefile.am: 
	moved HW register settings from bsp.h to hwreg_vals.h

2008-05-14	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* Makefile.am: Rework to avoid .rel files.

2008-05-12	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* Makefile.am, startup/bspstart.c: Refactored and renamed
	initialization routines to rtems_initialize_data_structures,
	rtems_initialize_before_drivers, rtems_initialize_device_drivers, and
	rtems_initialize_start_multitasking. This opened the sequence up so
	that bootcard() could provide a more robust and flexible framework
	which is easier to explain and understand. This also lays the
	groundwork for sharing the division of available memory between the
	RTEMS workspace and heap and the C library initialization across all
	BSPs.

2008-03-03	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/linkcmds, startup/linkcmds.hsc_cm01,
	startup/linkcmds.mpc8349eamds: Add wildcard to gcc_except_table
	section so programs compiled with gcc 4.3.x can link.

2008-01-22	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* Makefile.am: Remove duplicate cases of mmu.rel and timer.rel in list
	of objects.

2007-12-11	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* include/bsp.h, startup/bspstart.c: Eliminate copies of the
	Configuration Table. Use the RTEMS provided accessor macros to obtain
	configuration fields.

2007-12-05	Till Straumann <strauman@slac.stanford.edu>

	* irq/ipic.c, irq/irq_init.c:
	Converted exception vector names to new ones
	(qualified by <cpu_type> if non-std ppc exceptions).

2007-12-04	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/bspstart.c: Move interrupt_stack_size field from CPU Table to
	Configuration Table. Eliminate CPU Table from all ports. Delete
	references to CPU Table in all forms.

2007-12-04	Thomas Doerfler <Thomas.Doerfler@embedded-brains.de>

	* spi/spi_init.c: added missing file

2007-12-03	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* Makefile.am, startup/bspstart.c: Moved most of the remaining CPU
	Table fields to the Configuration Table. This included
	pretasking_hook, predriver_hook, postdriver_hook, idle_task,
	do_zero_of_workspace, extra_mpci_receive_server_stack,
	stack_allocate_hook, and stack_free_hook. As a side-effect of this
	effort some multiprocessing code was made conditional and some style
	clean up occurred.

2007-11-30	Till Straumann <strauman@slac.stanford.edu>

	* startup/bspstart: removed _Cpu_table.exceptions_in_RAM.

2007-11-30	Till Straumann <strauman@slac.stanford.edu>

	* irq/irq.h, irq/irq_init.c: Removed the definition
	of ASM_IRQ_VECTOR_BASE; this symbol was only use to
	initialize the irqBase member of the rtems_irq_global_settings
	struct. However, irqBase is an rtems_irq_symbolic_name,
	so using BSP_LOWEST_OFFSET is more appropriate.

2007-11-28	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/bspstart.c: Eliminate PowerPC specific elements from the CPU
	Table. They have been replaced with variables named bsp_XXX as
	needed.

2007-10-26	Thomas Doerfler <Thomas.Doerfler@embedded-brains.de>

	* startup/cpuinit.c: reenable instruction MMU

2007-10-26	Thomas Doerfler <Thomas.Doerfler@embedded-brains.de>

	* README.mpc8349eamds: added file

2007-10-26	Thomas Doerfler <Thomas.Doerfler@embedded-brains.de>

	* startup/bspstart.c, startup/linkcmds: 
	removed unneeded address definitions

2007-10-25	Thomas Doerfler <Thomas.Doerfler@embedded-brains.de>

	* include/bsp.h: fixed some typos

2007-10-25	Thomas Doerfler <Thomas.Doerfler@embedded-brains.de>

	* Makefile.am, spi/spi_init.c, include/bsp.h: add spi support

2007-09-17	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* console/console.c, irq/irq_init.c: Eliminate warnings.

2007-09-17	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* console/console.c: Eliminate DEBUG_puts.

2007-09-12	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	PR 1257/bsps
	* irq/irq_init.c: Code outside of cpukit should use the public API for
	rtems_interrupt_disable/rtems_interrupt_enable. By bypassing the
	public API and directly accessing _CPU_ISR_Disable and
	_CPU_ISR_Enable, they were bypassing the compiler memory barrier
	directive which could lead to problems. This patch also changes the
	type of the variable passed into these routines and addresses minor
	style issues.

2007-09-11	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* Makefile.am: Do not include networking drivers if networking is
	disabled.

2007-09-10	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* Makefile.am, preinstall.am: Install a linkcmds all the time.
	* startup/bspstart.c, startup/cpuinit.c,
	startup/linkcmds.mpc8349eamds, startup/mpc83xx_regs.c: Add missing 
	CVS Id.
