Background
==========

All serial cables described in this file were built using RJ-45 ribbon
cables which were plugged into DB-25 or DB-9 adapters wired as described.
Matching the colors of the wires in the shell is the easiest way to 
make sure the cable is built properly.

The board is configured as follows:

  - An MC68681 is the first two serial ports.  These are RS-232 and may
    be accessed via the front panel or the P2.  The front panel connector
    has both A and B serial ports on a single connector. DY-4 part number
    "OBYC3ASSY901132-000 Rev-" brings these ports out to two DB-25 
    female connectors.

  - The MC68681 serial ports are also accessible on the P2 connector.
    DY-4 part number "OBYC3ASSY901080-004 Rev A" brings these out
    to DB-9 female connectors.  These were not used in this effort.
