	* Makefile.am: Cleanup.

2000-11-14	Jiri Gaisler <jgais@ws.estec.esa.nl>

	* wrapup/Makefile.am: Pick up cache code from libcpu and pick
	up .o's instead of .rel's from libcpu.

2000-11-13	Jiri Gaisler <jgais@ws.estec.esa.nl>

	* Makefile.am, configure.in, gnatsupp/Makefile.am,
	gnatsupp/gnatsupp.c, include/Makefile.am, include/bsp.h,
	start/Makefile.am, startup/Makefile.am, startup/setvec.c,
	wrapup/Makefile.am:
	* erc32sonic: New directory.
	* erc32sonic/Makefile.am, erc32sonic/erc32sonic.c,
	erc32sonic/.cvsignore: New files.
	* include/erc32.h: New file.
	* startup/boardinit.S: New file.
	Big update of SPARC support for ERC32 and LEON.
	Added support for ERC32 without floating point.
	Added SONIC support as configured on Tharsys ERC32 board.
	The bsp's share various code in the shared directory:
	   gnat-support, start-up code, etc.
	To decrease the foot-print, I removed the 16 kbyte start-up
	stack that was put in .bss and never reused once the system
	was up. The stack is now put between the heap and the
	workspace. To reclaim it, the user can do a rtems_region_extend
	to merge the stack to the heap region once the system is up.

2000-11-09	Ralf Corsepius <corsepiu@faw.uni-ulm.de>

	* Makefile.am: Use ... instead of RTEMS_TOPdir in ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS.

2000-11-02	Ralf Corsepius <corsepiu@faw.uni-ulm.de>

	* Makefile.am: Switch to ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS = -I $(RTEMS_TOPdir)/aclocal.

2000-11-01	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/bspstart.c: assoc.h, error.h, libio_.h, libio.h,
	and libcsupport.h moved from libc to lib/include/rtems and
	now must be referenced as <rtems/XXX.h>.   Header file order
	was cleaned up while doing this.

2000-10-27	Ralf Corsepius <corsepiu@faw.uni-ulm.de>

	* configure.in, Makefile.am: ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS= -I $(RTEMS_TOPdir)/macros.
        Switch to GNU canonicalization.

2000-09-04	Ralf Corsepius <corsepiu@faw.uni-ulm.de>

	* clock/Makefile.am, console/Makefile.am, gnatsupp/Makefile.am,
	start/Makefile.am, startup/Makefile.am, timer/Makefile.am,
	wrapup/Makefile.am: Include compile.am
