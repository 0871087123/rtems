	* Makefile.am, preinstall.am: LEON3 AMBA PnP bus scanning moved to
	shared/amba/amba.c and shared/include/ambapp.h. The AMBA scanning was
	improved to take account for PnP info address translation. This is
	useful when scanning remote AMBA busses for example when a board
	connected with PCI has an AMBA bus that needs to be scanned, before
	the addresses was hard coded. Also, LEON2 now have AMBA PnP bus
	scanning support. By using the new AMBA scanning routines it is
	possible to isolate the AMBA scanning code to ambapp.c, however
	existing drivers should be updated to use them in order to save
	space.

	* include/bsp.h: This patch prepares bsp.h so that shared code (new
	drivers) can easily have small small sections of BSP specific code.

2007-05-11	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/spurious.c: Fix typo from previous commit.

2007-05-09	Joel Sherrill <joel.sherrill@OARcorp.com>

	* console/debugputs.c, include/bsp.h, leon_smc91111/leon_smc91111.c,
	startup/spurious.c: Remove debug print methods that are redundant
	with prntk and replace their use with printk.

2007-05-03	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* startup/linkcmds: Handle .data.* sections

2007-04-12	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* bsp_specs: Remove qrtems_debug.

2007-03-10	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	PR 1227/bsps
	* include/bsp.h: Remove MAX_LONG_TEST_DURATION and
	MAX_SHORT_TEST_DURATION. They are obsolete and unused.

2006-12-12	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* console/console.c, timer/timer.c: Use uint32_t instead of
	  rtems_unsigned32/unsigned32.

2006-12-02	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* configure.ac: New BUG-REPORT address.

2006-11-16	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* clock/ckinit.c: Use common clock driver template and eliminate all
	fast idle code specific to this BSP. This eliminates a fair amount of
	code in the BSP clock driver and bsp_startup. The LEON3 has to do a
	scan of the AMBA bus to find the timer so I added the new hook
	Clock_driver_support_find_timer to support this. In general, there
	was some clean up to the file headers of various files.

2006-11-15	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

	* Makefile.am: Merge c_rtems_main() into boot_card(). This eliminated a
	file and simplified initialization.

2006-10-17	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* Makefile.am: Remove superfluous -DASM.

2006-10-17	Ralf Corsépius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* configure.ac: Require autoconf-2.60. Require automake-1.10.

2006-06-24	Joel Sherrill <joel@OARcorp.com>

2006-01-11	Ralf Corsepius <ralf.corsepius@rtems.org>

	* configure.ac: Remove explicit ampolish3 support (now in
	RTEMS_BSP_CONFIGURE).
