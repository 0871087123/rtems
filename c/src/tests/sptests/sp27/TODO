This test should be for rtems_semaphore_flush.  It will be something like:

TaskA:
        create semaphore with initial count 0
        start taskB and TaskC (Higher priority than taskA, no round-robin)
        print message
        semaphore_flush

TaskB/C:
        obtain semaphore
        print message
        suspend/delete self

Successful test would show message from both tasks B and C after the
message from task A.
