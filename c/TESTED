The RTEMS Project does not have all of the development computers or
target boards included in the RTEMS distribution.  Many of the BSPs
are user supplied and we try to insure that they compile before each
full release.  This file describes the range of configurations the 
RTEMS project can internally test.

Host Development Systems
========================

All RTEMS development is done on a Sun SPARCStation running Solaris 2.3 and
all other host systems are not tested internally.

Target Systems
==============

The following table describes the testability of each BSP by the RTEMS project:

    CPU     CPU
   FAMILY  MODEL         TARGET              STATUS

(1) Target board is not owned by RTEMS Project.  The target is known
    to compile and link with all appropriate tests successfully.
    If the target does not support multiprocessor configurations, then
    "ALL TESTS" does not include the multiprocessor tests.
 
(2) RTEMS Project cannot internally compile or test this target.
 
(3) Target is not intended to be executed.  It is only an example.
 
(4) The RTEMS Project owns this board but it is broken at the moment.

(5) The RTEMS Project owns a Linux host but does not regularly test this BSP.
