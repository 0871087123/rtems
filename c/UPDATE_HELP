In the directory "update_tools", there are a set of tools to aid in
making the application source changes necessary to address some
of the changes in the RTEMS API between release 3.1.0 and 3.2.0.

The primary change addressed by these tools is the addition of
"rtems_" or "RTEMS_" as a prefix on EVERY user visible RTEMS
provided constant and routine.  The primary factor in the decision
to make such a sweeping change was conflicts between the
the RTEMS and POSIX API's.

WARNING: These tools modify the files IN PLACE!!! Backup your
  source before using these tools.
