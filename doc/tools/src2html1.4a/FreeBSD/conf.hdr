The <tt>conf</tt> directory holds miscellaneous files, such as the list of
files which are needed/optional in the OS. The main file of concern is
<tt>param.c</tt>, which describes the system-dependent configuration
parameters of FreeBSD.

The 4.3BSD Internals book by Leffler, McKusick, Karels and Quarterman
doesn't really cover this directory. It is vaguely covered in Chapter 8 of
the "System Performance Tuning" Nutshell book by Mike Loukides.
