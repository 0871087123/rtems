The <tt>vm</tt> directory holds the virtual memory subsystem used by
FreeBSD. This was derived from the VM system used in the Mach kernel,
with the interface to the rest of the kernel rewritten. As such, it is
not described in the
4.3BSD Internals book by Leffler, McKusick, Karels and Quarterman,
but it is described by Kirk KcKusick and Keith Bostic in their
"UNIX Kernel Internals"
notes, which they have presented in many places in the past few years.
