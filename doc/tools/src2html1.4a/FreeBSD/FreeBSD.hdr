Welcome to the hyperlinked source code tree for FreeBSD-2.1.0. This is an
attempt at a WWW document that allows you to find functions, structs
etc. in the FreeBSD source code by name.<p>

If you are interested in a particular type of symbols (e.g functions), use
the type links below. If you are interested in a particular directory in
FreeBSD, choose the directory link below.<p>

Follow the links until you reach the source code you are interested in.<p>

<h3>Bugs and Missing Features</h3>

I am using ctags and perl to find the symbols and produce the html documents.
My parsing of the ctags output (especially for variables) seems slightly
wrong. I'd appreciate a better way of doing things.<p>

The final code should have hyperlinks that allow you to follow references
to other symbols in the tree (e.g calls to bread() etc). This is difficult
given C's scoping rules, and I don't want to write a C grammar parser.
Until I can think of a clean way, I'll omit the desired hyperlinks.<p>
