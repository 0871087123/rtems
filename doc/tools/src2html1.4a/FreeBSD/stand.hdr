The <tt>stand</tt> directory holds functions that are useful, but cannot be
called from the kernel. For example printf() is great, but if the kernel
called printf() it would generate a TRAP and wind up back in the kernel.<p>

The functions here emulate these functions by dealing directly with the
hardware on the system.<p>

The 4.3BSD Internals book by Leffler, McKusick, Karels and Quarterman
