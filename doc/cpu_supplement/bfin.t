@chapter Blackfin Specific Information

This chapter discusses the Blackfin architecture dependencies
in this port of RTEMS.  

@subheading Architecture Documents

For information on the Blackfin architecture,
refer to the following documents available from
Analog Devices.

@section CPU Model Dependent Features


CPUs of the Blackfin 53X only differ in the perifericals
and thus in the device drivers. This port does not yet
support the 56X dual core variants.

@subsection CPU Model Name

The macro @code{CPU_MODEL_NAME} is a string which designates
the architectural level of this CPU model.  The following is
a list of the settings for this string based upon @code{gcc}
CPU model predefines:

@example
"BF533"
@end example

@subsection Count Leading Zeroes Instruction

The Blackfin CPU has the BITTST instruction
which could be used to speed up the find first bit
operation.  The use of this instruction should significantly speed up
the scheduling associated with a thread blocking.

@subsection Floating Point Unit

The macro BF_HAS_FPU is set to 0 to indicate that
this CPU model has no hardware floating point unit.
Blackfin CPUs don't have floating point so 

@section Calling Conventions

Each high-level language compiler generates
subroutine entry and exit code based upon a set of rules known
as the compiler's calling convention.   These rules address the
following issues:

@itemize @bullet
@item register preservation and usage
@item parameter passing
@item call and return mechanism
@end itemize

A compiler's calling convention is of importance when
interfacing to subroutines written in another language either
assembly or high-level.  Even when the high-level language and
target processor are the same, different compilers may use
different calling conventions.  As a result, calling conventions
are both processor and compiler dependent.

This section is heavily based on content taken from the
Blackfin uCLinux documentation wiki which is edited
by Analog Devices and Arcturus Networks.
@file{http://docs.blackfin.uclinux.org/}

@subsection Processor Background


The Blackfin architecture supports a simple call and return mechanism.
A subroutine is invoked via the call (@code{call}) instruction.
This instruction saves the return address in the @code{RETS} register
and transfers the execution to the given address.

It is the called funcions responsability to use the link instruction to
reserve space on the stack for the local variables.
Returning from a subroutine is done by using the RTS (@code{RTS})
instruction which loads the PC with the adress stored in RETS.

It is is important to note that the @code{call} instruction does not
automatically save or restore any registers.  It is the
responsibility of the high-level language compiler to define the
register preservation and usage convention.

@subsection Register Usage

A called function may clobber all registers, except RETS, R4-R7, P3-P5, FP and SP. 
It may also modify the first 12 bytes in the callerâ€™s stack frame which is used as
an argument area for the first three arguments (which are passed in R0...R3 but may
be placed on the stack by the called function).

@subsection Parameter Passing

RTEMS assumes that the Blackfin GCC calling convention is followed.
The first three parameters are stored in registers R0, R1, and R2.
All other parameters are put pushed on the stack.
The result is returned through register R0.

@subsection User-Provided Routines

All user-provided routines invoked by RTEMS, such as
user extensions, device drivers, and MPCI routines, must also
adhere to these calling conventions.

@section Memory Model

The Blackfin family architecutre support a single unified 4
G byte address space using 32-bit addresses. It maps all
resources like internal and external memory and IO registers
into separate sections of this common address space.

The Blackfin architcture supporst some form of memory
protection via its Memory Management Unit. Since the
Blackfin port runs in supervisior mode this memory
protection mechanisms are not used.

@section Interrupt Processing

Discussed in this chapter are the Blackfin's
interrupt response and control mechanisms as they pertain to
RTEMS. The Blackfin architecture support 16 kinds of
interrupts broken down into Core and general-purpose
interrupts.

@subsection Vectoring of an Interrupt Handler

RTEMS maps levels 0 -15 directly to Blackfins event
vectors EVT0 - EVT15. Since EVT0 - EVT6 are core
events and it is suggested to use EVT15 and EVT15 for
Software interrupts, 7 Interrupts (EVT7-EVT13) are left
for periferical use.

When installing an RTEMS interrupt handler RTEMS installs
a generic Interrupt Handler which saves some context and
enables nested interrupt servicing and then vectors
to the users interrupt handler.

@subsection Disabling of Interrupts by RTEMS

During the execution of directive calls, critical
sections of code may be executed.  When these sections are
encountered, RTEMS disables interrupts to level four (4) before
the execution of this section and restores them to the previous
level upon completion of the section. RTEMS uses the instructions
CLI and STI to enable and disable Interrupts. Emulation,
Reset, NMI and Exception Interrupts are never disabled.

@subsection Interrupt Stack

The Blackfin Architecuter works with two different kind of stacks,
User and Supervisor Stack. Since RTEMS and its Application run
in supervisor mode, all interrupts will use the interrupted
tasks stack for execution.

@section Default Fatal Error Processing

the @code{rtems_fatal_error_occurred} directive when there is
no user handler configured or the user handler returns control to
RTEMS.  The default fatal error handler performs the
following actions:

@itemize @bullet
@item disables processor interrupts,
@item places the error code in @b{r0}, and
@item executes an infinite loop (@code{while(0);} to
simulate a halt processor instruction.
@end itemize
