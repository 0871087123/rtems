@unnumbered Preface

The Real Time Executive for Multiprocessor Systems
(RTEMS) is designed to be portable across multiple processor
architectures.  However, the nature of real-time systems makes
it essential that the application designer understand certain
processor dependent implementation details.  These processor
dependencies include calling convention, board support package
issues, interrupt processing, exact RTEMS memory requirements,
performance data, header files, and the assembly language
interface to the executive.

This document discusses the SPARC architecture
dependencies in this port of RTEMS.  Currently, only
implementations of SPARC Version 7 are supported by RTEMS.

It is highly recommended that the SPARC RTEMS
application developer obtain and become familiar with the
documentation for the processor being used as well as the
specification for the revision of the SPARC architecture which
corresponds to that processor.

@subheading ERC32 Specific Information

The European Space Agency's ERC32 is a three chip
computing core implementing a SPARC V7 processor and associated
support circuitry for embedded space applications. The integer
and floating-point units (90C601E & 90C602E) are based on the
Cypress 7C601 and 7C602, with additional error-detection and
recovery functions. The memory controller (MEC) implements
system support functions such as address decoding, memory
interface, DMA interface, UARTs, timers, interrupt control,
write-protection, memory reconfiguration and error-detection.
The core is designed to work at 25MHz, but using space qualified
memories limits the system frequency to around 15 MHz, resulting
in a performance of 10 MIPS and 2 MFLOPS.

Information on the ERC32 and a number of development
support tools, such as the SPARC Instruction Simulator (SIS),
are freely available on the Internet.  The following documents
and SIS are available via anonymous ftp or pointing your web
browser at ftp://ftp.estec.esa.nl/pub/ws/wsd/erc32.

point units including the instruction set information.  To
