@unnumbered Preface

The Real Time Executive for Multiprocessor Systems
(RTEMS) is designed to be portable across multiple processor
architectures.  However, the nature of real-time systems makes
it essential that the application designer understand certain
processor dependent implementation details.  These processor
dependencies include calling convention, board support package
issues, interrupt processing, exact RTEMS memory requirements,
performance data, header files, and the assembly language
interface to the executive.

For information on the i960CA and the i960 processor
family in general, refer to the following documents:

Microprocessor Architecture. Wiley. New York. 1988}.

It is highly recommended that the i960CA RTEMS
application developer obtain and become familiar with Intel's
i960CA User's Manual.
