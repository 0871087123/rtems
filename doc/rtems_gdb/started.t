@section Getting Started

This section describes the steps which are necessary to set up a
debugging session with RTEMS/GDB.


@subsection Compiling The System Components

The components that need to be debugged have to be compiled with the -g option
in order the generated file to contain the required information for the debug
session.


@subsection Starting a debugging session

After having launched GDB, the user must connect to the RTEMS target with the
following commands:

@example

(gdb) setrpcmode sun

(gdb) setdaemontype rdbg

(gdb) target rtems target-name

@end example

Then he can use the file GDB command to specify the binary to be debugged.

This initialization phase can be written in a @code{``.gdbinit''}
file. Each time, the user will launch GDB, it will execute this initialization
sequence.


@subsection Attaching To The System

The entire target system is viewed as a single multi-threaded process,
the identifier of which is 1. To attach, use:

@example
(gdb) attach 1
@end example

When successfully attached, the user can control the execution of
the target system from the debugger.
