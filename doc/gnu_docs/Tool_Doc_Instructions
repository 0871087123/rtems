Apparently, the tool documentation is tough to build without configuring
in the tool source directory.  So you need to do some magic to make
this happen.  In addition, the makefiles only support building dvi
and info.

mkdir doc_build
cp -r binutils-XXX gcc-XXX gdb-XXX newlib-XXX doc_build

# for each tool
cd binutils-XXX
./configure --target=i386-rtems --prefix=/usr3/tmp/DOCTMP
make info dvi

# for newlib we have to do the build differently
mkdir b
cd b
../newlib-1.8.2/./configure --target=i386-rtems --prefix=/usr3/tmp/DOCTMP
make 
make info dvi 
cd ../newlib-1.8.2
find newlib/ -name "*.t*" | cpio -pdum ../b/i386-rtems/
find etc/ -name "*.t*" | cpio -pdum ../b


NOTE: The actual target is not relevant since the documentation is
always the same.
