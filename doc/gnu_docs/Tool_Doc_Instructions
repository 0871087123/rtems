Apparently, the tool documentation is tough to build without configuring
in the tool source directory.  So you need to do some magic to make
this happen.  In addition, the makefiles included with the tools
only support building dvi and info.  So this directory is
trying to help finish out building the tool documentation.

# Odd Notes:
#
# binutils/ld: May have to copy bfdsumm.texi from config/bfd to ld
# gcc: no rule to build java.dvi

# for binutils, gcc, and gdb
mkdir doc_build
cp -r binutils-XXX gcc-XXX gdb-XXX newlib-XXX doc_build
cd TOOL-XXX
./configure --target=i386-rtems --prefix=/usr3/tmp/DOCTMP
make info dvi

# for newlib we have to do the build differently.  It actually needs
# to be configured and built for an RTEMS target so pick something
# you have tools installed for.  Hopefully, this will be a target
# without many multilib variants. The actual target is not relevant
# since the documentation is always the same.

mkdir b
cd b
../newlib-1.8.2/configure --target=i386-rtems --prefix=/usr3/tmp/DOCTMP
make 
make info dvi 
cd ../newlib-1.8.2
find newlib/ -name "*.t*" | cpio -pdum ../b/i386-rtems/
find etc/ -name "*.t*" | cpio -pdum ../b
cd ../b
# run the script
